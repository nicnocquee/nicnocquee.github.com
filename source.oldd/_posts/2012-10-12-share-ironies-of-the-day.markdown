Two [situational ironies](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/irony) of the day:

First, [Rich dad went bankrupt](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2215642/Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad-bankrupt-dad-Best-selling-author-files-corporate-bankruptcy-losing-24m-judgement.html#comments):

{% blockquote %}
The financial guru behind New York Times bestseller Rich Dad, Poor Dad has filed for bankruptcy on one of his companies after losing a $24 million judgement.
{% endblockquote %}

Oops.

<!-- more -->

And second, recent Noble Prize winner, [John Gurdon's idea of becoming scientist was deemed ridiculous by his teacher](http://boingboing.net/2012/10/11/great-moments-in-irony.html).

An excerpt from his 1949 high school report card:

{% blockquote %}
His work has been far from satisfactory…. Several times he has been in trouble, because he will not listen, but will insist on doing his work in his own way. I believe he has ideas about becoming a Scientist; on his present showing this is quite ridiculous… it would be a sheer waste of time, both on his part and of those who have to teach him.
{% endblockquote %}

Oops.

Guess [Forrest Gump](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109830/) was right.
