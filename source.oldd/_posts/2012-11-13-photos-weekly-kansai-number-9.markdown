The peak of autumn has started last week in Japan. Leaves have turned yellow and red. Comes autumn, Japanese usually go to places with beautiful view of colorful leaves for picnic. It is called *紅葉狩り* (momijigari). But heavy rain hit this part of Japan today. Hopefully the leaves can hold on until the end of the week. Because we haven't gone to see *紅葉* (kouyou). 

Have you gone to see 紅葉? Where did you go?

![Usually I passed by the front of #Koshien stadium to go back home. But today, I was attracted by the #sun rays showering the back side of the stadium. Then I saw an old man standing still looking down. Passing by him, I thought, "is he dead standing?" Few meters away, I unintentionally looked down at the floor. I abruptly hit my #bicycle's break. Then I knew what the old man was looking at. There were hundreds of tiles with text engraved. Not really sure what they were. There were names. I passed this path before, but never noticed these tiles cause always passed there at night. Who knew. Found something new just by breaking the habit. #kobe #kansai #japan #autumn #nature #cool](http://distilleryimage5.s3.amazonaws.com/7900ab9627e311e2984522000a1f8ad9_7.jpg)
