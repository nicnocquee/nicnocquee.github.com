Woah, it's already end of November. One more month and comes 2013. Time flies indeed. Last week has been a very busy week. Didn't go out much during weekday. Only went to Junkudo Umeda, the biggest book store in Japan. And boy it was big. Seven floors of books heaven. And if you like reading English novels, books, you're gonna like the 6th floor. 

From Junkudo, we walked around parts of Umeda that we had never been to. I thought I knew Umeda like the back of my hand. But there's more than meet the ferries wheel. :p
