<p>My first app was a bingo game. Prior to that, I had only learned Java in college. Before learning Java, I always thought that software was the result of magic. When I entered master course in Japan, I was coding sloppily in C for research. Mostly playing with <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">GNU Scientific Library</a>. I didn&#8217;t have a Mac nor iPhone. I even teased my friend who used OSX on his laptop back in college.</p>

<p>A year passed by since I took master course and I still had no idea what I was doing. Then I stumbled upon an article by <a href="http://www.dannychoo.com">Danny Choo</a> about his passion and how he started his career. I can&#8217;t recall which article it was but probably this article about <a href="http://www.dannychoo.com/en/post/1691/Pursue+Your+Passion+A+Summary.html">pursuing passion</a> or this article about <a href="http://www.dannychoo.com/en/post/26094/How+Discovering+Japan+Changed+My+Life.html">how discovering Japan changed his life</a>. Reading about his life got me thinking that I needed to find something I&#8217;m passionate about. After digging through more articles on his website, I saw his iMac. I was amazed by how beautiful it was. I ended up buying one for myself. My very first Apple product.</p>

<p>One day in the class room, I saw my Japanese friend was playing with his shiny black phone. I was interested so I asked if I could take a look. There was only one button. And it has this slide to unlock mechanism. Mind. Blown. It was iPhone 3GS. My very first iPhone.</p>

<p>Having free time and lack of interest in what I was doing at that time, I decided to get the Apple Developer Program. Learning Objective-C, submitting my first app, and receiving my first payment from the App Store admittedly changed my life. I decided to quit my PhD and took a job in a startup in Japan as an iOS developer.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m writing this to support <a href="http://appdocumentary.com">App: The Human Story</a>. I didn&#8217;t plan to write anything since I figured my story is not that exciting. I haven&#8217;t made any hit game or app like Flappy Bird. But I&#8217;m making a living doing what I&#8217;m passionate about and I want to share it with others. I&#8217;m also pretty proud of the app I&#8217;m making for the company, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/monoco-monoko-akusesarinoserekutoshoppu/id539376693?mt=8">Monoco (Japan App Store only)</a>, and my own latest app, <a href="http://www.getdelightfulapp.com">Delightful</a>.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re an app developer, help them to reach their goal in <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/appdocu/app-the-human-story">kickstarter</a> and spread the word. It seems like it&#8217;s gonna be an interesting documentary.</p>
