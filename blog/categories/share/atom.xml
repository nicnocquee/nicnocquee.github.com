    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bekkelund.net/">Martin Bekkelund</a> on <a href="http://www.bekkelund.net/2012/10/22/outlawed-by-amazon-drm/">Outlawed by Amazon DRM</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Did she violate any terms? Amazon will not tell. Perhaps by accident? Amazon does not care. The conclusion so far is clear: Amazon closed her account, wiped her Kindle and refuses to tell her why. End of discussion.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>If the claim to be trusted, the fact that Amazon refused to give any reasons is very disturbing. I understand, though not favoring, that Amazon, like Apple, has the right to do pretty much anything they want with their device and platform. But punishing a customer without warning and explanation is far from being classy.</p>

<p>As a husband of a wife who uses Amazon Kindle everyday, I found this news very saddening. Because we like Kindle. The first generation Kindle we have is the best device for reading. Better than the iPad in that area. Not to mention iBook in Japan is pretty much deserted. With its simplicity in purchasing and the vast collection of books, Amazon Kindle has become our favorite book store.</p>

<p>Cory Doctorow on <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/10/22/kindle-user-claims-amazon-dele.html">Kindle user claims Amazon deleted whole library without explanation</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>This fine print will always have a clause that says you are a mere tenant farmer of your books, and not their owner, and your right to carry around your "purchases" (which are really conditional licenses, despite misleading buttons labelled with words like "Buy this with one click" -- I suppose "Conditionally license this with one click" is deemed too cumbersome for a button) can be revoked without notice or explanation (or, notably, refund) at any time.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>I agree with replacing the "Buy this with one click" button to "Conditionally license this with one click". At least people will know that they won't really own what they are about to purchase and proceed with their own risks.</p>

<p>I guess it's inevitable for a company who started small then turned big to become evil. Apple, Google, Twitter, just to name a few. And now (or has it been for a long time?) is Amazon's turn.</p>

    <id>http://nicnocquee.com/blog/2012/10/14/share-tos-lie</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://images.cheezburger.com/completestore/2011/8/19/601e324e-1e21-419a-843a-ff22db559ccc.jpg" alt="Biggest lie" /></p>

<p>It's a well known fact that the biggest lie on the internet, or software world, is "I have read the terms of service". Who would have the time (and patience) to read that very long  mambo-jambo? We would use it anyway. Because everybody is using it, right?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>There are some people who try to fix this culture of lies. There is <a href="http://tos-dr.info/">Terms of Service; Didn't read</a> who tries to simplify the Terms of Service (TOS) of web services and it's doing a pretty good job actually. I just found out that users cannot delete their account in some famous services such as Skype and Wordpress. Surprising.</p>

<p>Another attempt circulating around the tech-sphere recently is <a href="http://rapgenius.com/Apple-itunes-terms-of-service-lyrics">RapGenius' explanations of Apple's iTunes TOS</a> where people are trying to explain some parts of the agreement in witty ways. Though I can't help but wonder what's with the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX8fKLjC__c">Human Centipede</a> references.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3k3e1j2a1w383o3o0y2g/Screen%20Shot%202012-10-14%20at%209.42.38%20PM.png" alt="iTunes Terms of Service" /></p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/2T2c0x1p3I1f0W2b0u3J/Screen%20Shot%202012-10-14%20at%209.43.14%20PM.png" alt="It's not so much of agreement" /></p>

<p>If you notice, similar TOS can be found in any other services or softwares. It's not just Apple. Every companies serve us this thing for one simple reason. They don't want us to sue them if anything bad happens.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3g3f0M3E200v2p311f0R/Screen%20Shot%202012-10-14%20at%2010.20.17%20PM.png" alt="500px's TOS" /></p>

<p>The only service that does TOS right is <a href="http://500px.com/">500px</a>. Every companies should follow <a href="http://500px.com/terms">500px's way of presenting TOS</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.marco.org/">Marco Ament</a> on the <a href="http://the-magazine.org/1/foreword">Foreword of The Magazine</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Many iPad magazines are carrying unnecessary and expensive baggage from their print days. Some born-digital magazines even took on print baggage simply because they thought they needed it.</p></blockquote></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Indeed.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3D3n1h3g0D1Q1s2a0p02/2012-10-12%20at%2005:27.png" alt="The Magazine for iPad" /></p>

<p>With many problems like the <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2012/04/04/apple-investigating-new-ipad-wifi-issues-tells-applecare-to-replace-affected-units/">wifi issue</a>, I have been hesitant to upgrade my iPad to iOS 6. But The Magazine is approved by <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/10/11/the-magazine">John Grubber</a>. And concurred by <a href="http://parislemon.com/post/33417889715/marco-arment-launches-the-magazine">MG Siegler</a>. A week free trial. Furthermore, I like reading articles. And this one looks slick. But it needs iOS 6. There, I installed it. Let's see if it's worth it. You can download The Magazine from the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/magazine-for-geeks-like-us./id557744510?mt=8">App Store</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/irony">situational ironies</a> of the day:</p>

<p>First, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2215642/Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad-bankrupt-dad-Best-selling-author-files-corporate-bankruptcy-losing-24m-judgement.html#comments">Rich dad went bankrupt</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>The financial guru behind New York Times bestseller Rich Dad, Poor Dad has filed for bankruptcy on one of his companies after losing a $24 million judgement.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Oops.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>And second, recent Noble Prize winner, <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/10/11/great-moments-in-irony.html">John Gurdon's idea of becoming scientist was deemed ridiculous by his teacher</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/gurdon-600x293.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>An excerpt from his 1949 high school report card:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>His work has been far from satisfactory…. Several times he has been in trouble, because he will not listen, but will insist on doing his work in his own way. I believe he has ideas about becoming a Scientist; on his present showing this is quite ridiculous… it would be a sheer waste of time, both on his part and of those who have to teach him.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Oops.</p>

<p>Guess <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109830/">Forrest Gump</a> was right.</p>
