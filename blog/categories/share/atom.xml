    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/irony">situational ironies</a> of the day:</p>

<p>First, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2215642/Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad-bankrupt-dad-Best-selling-author-files-corporate-bankruptcy-losing-24m-judgement.html#comments">Rich dad went bankrupt</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>The financial guru behind New York Times bestseller Rich Dad, Poor Dad has filed for bankruptcy on one of his companies after losing a $24 million judgement.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Oops.</p>

<p>And second, recent Noble Prize winner, <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/10/11/great-moments-in-irony.html">John Gurdon's idea of becoming scientist was deemed ridiculous by his teacher</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/gurdon-600x293.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>An excerpt from his 1949 high school report card:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>His work has been far from satisfactory…. Several times he has been in trouble, because he will not listen, but will insist on doing his work in his own way. I believe he has ideas about becoming a Scientist; on his present showing this is quite ridiculous… it would be a sheer waste of time, both on his part and of those who have to teach him.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Oops.</p>

<p>Guess <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109830/">Forrest Gump</a> was right.</p>

<p>Here is a new blog that you have to follow.<!-- more -->
From the creator of XKCD, a new blog to answer hypothetical questions with physics, <a href="http://what-if.xkcd.com/">What If</a>. I'm so fascinated by Randall Munroe's curiosity and deep analytical skill shown in this blog.</p>

<p>Oh, and you should read this <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/09/a-conversation-with-randall-munroe-the-creator-of-xkcd/262851/">conversation with the guy himself</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>There are a lot of people who have written books about creativity that I haven't read, so I'm not by any means an expert on it, but my impression is that being creative is just a combination of getting new stimulus, but also having periods where you're not getting any stimulus. I had to stop reading Reddit sometime a few years ago, because I found that whenever I'd bump into a problem that was going to take a little time to solve, I'd just switch over and refresh Reddit and distract myself. Depriving myself of that has definitely been an important part of actually getting anything done, ever.</p></p><p><p>But at the same time, if you're just staring at your room with no Internet or no connection, you just go crazy and don't have anything to give you any ideas at all.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Not with Reddit, but happens to me many times too.</p>
