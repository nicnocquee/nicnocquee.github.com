    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Japan Probe on <a href="http://www.japanprobe.com/2012/10/24/fake-monk-fundraising-scam-targets-foreign-tourists-in-tokyo/">Fake monk fundraising scam targets foreign tourists in Tokyo</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>The “monks” approach tourists, hand them a golden good luck charm, and ask for a donation. Many tourists are happy to donate to such a noble cause. The fundraisers seem to target foreign tourists, but they also occasionally approach Japanese people. In a short time, the men can raise many thousands of yen.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>My wife was a victim of this. And I don't think she was happy to donate, because the monk was persistent to the point of forcing. She was victimized in Takeshita Street of Harajuku. Be extra careful, people.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/1v1O2A290s0k0p0r2A1t/ipadmini.jpg" alt="The iPad mini" /></p>

<p>First thing I did this morning when I woke up was to pick up my iPad which was lying on the side of my bed all night, opened Safari, typed in apple.com. iPad mini was the first thing I saw. Watching the video of the iPad mini, me and wifey thought, "we want it!" It looks lighter, and easier to hold.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>But then, John Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/10/23/ipad-mini-dalrymple">said</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Screen resolution-wise, it’s exactly what I expected for a 163 PPI display in 2012: noticeably nicer than the 133 PPI iPad 1/2, noticeably worse than the 266 PPI iPad 3/4. The iPad Mini display seems brighter and to have better contrast than the iPhone 3GS display, but unsurprisingly, rendered text looks exactly like it does on the 3GS.</p></blockquote></p>

<p><strong>Rendered text looks exactly like it does on the 3GS</strong>. Now that's a turn off. The thing I like the most from iPhone 4/4S and the (not so) new iPad was the retina display which display text sharply. If this iPad mini cannot do that, I guess we'll wait for the next generation.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0W142R2S1J3B080O1A0b/imac.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then we watched the <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/october-2012/">keynote</a>. Tim Cook took the stage as usual. Boring. Then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Schiller">Phil Schiller </a>came in. We kinda like this guy. As my wife said, "Phil doesn't try to be Steve Jobs when he's on stage." I agreed with her. He showed the new 13" Macbook Pro with Retina Display, new Mac Mini, and then. <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/features/">The new iMac</a>. It's amazing. I was stunned. Very thin. Very beautiful. It deserves the title of the queen of the event.</p>

<p>But what excites me the most about this iMac is it feels Job-sy. First, it's unexpected. Nobody predicted this. Everybody was so busy talking about the iPad mini. No rumors (as far as I know) talked about the new iMac. It's the surprise that I have been missing from apple events since the first iPad. Second, Apple made a bold move by removing optical drive from this new iMac. iMac is a desktop computer. With many DVDs and Blu-rays still being sold these days, removing the optical drive from a desktop computer required the guts and courage only Jobs has. And Apple still has it. Good job. Your move, Samsung.</p>

<p>Final thought, stil hoping for Macbook Air 11" with Retina display…</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bekkelund.net/">Martin Bekkelund</a> on <a href="http://www.bekkelund.net/2012/10/22/outlawed-by-amazon-drm/">Outlawed by Amazon DRM</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Did she violate any terms? Amazon will not tell. Perhaps by accident? Amazon does not care. The conclusion so far is clear: Amazon closed her account, wiped her Kindle and refuses to tell her why. End of discussion.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>If the claim to be trusted, the fact that Amazon refused to give any reasons is very disturbing. I understand, though not favoring, that Amazon, like Apple, has the right to do pretty much anything they want with their device and platform. But punishing a customer without warning and explanation is far from being classy.</p>

<p>As a husband of a wife who uses Amazon Kindle everyday, I found this news very saddening. Because we like Kindle. The first generation Kindle we have is the best device for reading. Better than the iPad in that area. Not to mention iBook in Japan is pretty much deserted. With its simplicity in purchasing and the vast collection of books, Amazon Kindle has become our favorite book store.</p>

<p>Cory Doctorow on <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/10/22/kindle-user-claims-amazon-dele.html">Kindle user claims Amazon deleted whole library without explanation</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>This fine print will always have a clause that says you are a mere tenant farmer of your books, and not their owner, and your right to carry around your "purchases" (which are really conditional licenses, despite misleading buttons labelled with words like "Buy this with one click" -- I suppose "Conditionally license this with one click" is deemed too cumbersome for a button) can be revoked without notice or explanation (or, notably, refund) at any time.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>I agree with replacing the "Buy this with one click" button to "Conditionally license this with one click". At least people will know that they won't really own what they are about to purchase and proceed with their own risks.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/1X0p312P0E2d2g3q0U3S/Screen%20Shot%202012-10-23%20at%202.01.56%20AM.png" alt="Don't buy a Kindle https://twitter.com/paulg/status/260400550422646785" /></p>

<p>I guess it's inevitable for a company who started small then turned big to become evil. Apple, Google, Twitter, just to name a few. And now (or has it been for a long time?) is Amazon's turn.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.</p></blockquote></p>
