    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/1v1O2A290s0k0p0r2A1t/ipadmini.jpg" alt="The iPad mini" /></p>

<p>First thing I did this morning when I woke up was to pick up my iPad which was lying on the side of my bed all night, opened Safari, typed in apple.com. iPad mini was the first thing I saw. Watching the video of the iPad mini, me and wifey thought, "we want it!" It looks lighter, and easier to hold.</p>

<p>But then, John Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/10/23/ipad-mini-dalrymple">said</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Screen resolution-wise, it’s exactly what I expected for a 163 PPI display in 2012: noticeably nicer than the 133 PPI iPad 1/2, noticeably worse than the 266 PPI iPad 3/4. The iPad Mini display seems brighter and to have better contrast than the iPhone 3GS display, but unsurprisingly, rendered text looks exactly like it does on the 3GS.</p></blockquote></p>

<p><strong>Rendered text looks exactly like it does on the 3GS</strong>. Now that's a turn off. The thing I like the most from iPhone 4/4S and the (not so) new iPad was the retina display which display text sharply. If this iPad mini cannot do that, I guess we'll wait for the next generation.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0W142R2S1J3B080O1A0b/imac.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then we watched the <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/october-2012/">keynote</a>. Tim Cook took the stage as usual. Boring. Then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Schiller">Phil Schiller </a>came in. We kinda like this guy. As my wife said, "Phil doesn't try to be Steve Jobs when he's on stage." I agreed with her. He showed the new 13" Macbook Pro with Retina Display, new Mac Mini, and then. <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/features/">The new iMac</a>. It's amazing. I was stunned. Very thin. Very beautiful. It deserves the title of the queen of the event.</p>

<p>But what excites me the most about this iMac is it feels Job-sy. First, it's unexpected. Nobody predicted this. Everybody was so busy talking about the iPad mini. No rumors (as far as I know) talked about the new iMac. It's the surprise that I have been missing from apple events since the first iPad. Second, Apple made a bold move by removing optical drive from this new iMac. iMac is a desktop computer. With many DVDs and Blu-rays still being sold these days, removing the optical drive from a desktop computer required the guts and courage only Jobs has. And Apple still has it. Good job. Your move, Samsung.</p>

<p>Final thought, stil hoping for Macbook Air 11" with Retina display…</p>

<p>Some previous amusing works by Samsung's designers:</p>

<p>More <a href="http://samsungcopiesapple.tumblr.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>We all can call Samsung shameless copycat. But there's just no reason, but conscience, to stop executing this strategy. The worst that could happen to them was a mere <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/jury-returns-verdict-in-apple-v-samsung/">$1 billion</a>. Nothing compared to their <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/10/05/samsung-record-7-1-billion-profit/">$7.3 billion profit</a>.</p>

<p>This strategy just works.</p>

    <link href="http://nicnocquee.com/blog/2012/09/27/thoughts-opened-facebook-and-twitter-after-a-week/"/>
    <updated>2012-09-27T09:49:00+09:00</updated>
    <id>http://nicnocquee.com/blog/2012/09/27/thoughts-opened-facebook-and-twitter-after-a-week</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I decided to take a break from Facebook and Twitter. I deleted Facebook and Twitter app from my iPhone and resisted from opening Facebook and Twitter from the web. The reason was pretty simple. I felt that Facebook and Twitter <em>toxicated</em> my mind. There were too many posts or Tweets that were boring, stupid, unnecessary, and I found insulting to what I believe in. To respond to those posts or tweets would not only waste my time, but also mentally exhausting. Not to mention debating over something that will never have common agreement always leaves bad taste in my mouth. Therefore, I chose to keep a distance from Twitter and Facebook.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Surprisingly, I survived without opening them for a week. It was kinda weird feeling. A day without notifications felt like something was missing. There were these empty time slots in my day that I chose to fill with reading one of the books that I have piled up digitally, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SEGEKI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000SEGEKI&linkCode=as2&tag=everlasti-20">The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=everlasti-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000SEGEKI" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0O3S1u211Q2D043o070s/Screen%20Shot%202012-09-26%20at%2011.37.54%20AM.png" alt="49 Facebook Notifications" /></p>

<p>Then yesterday I opened Facebook and Twitter. I found two interesting things. The first one was on Facebook. In a week, I got 49 notifications in which only around 10 were comments or likes to my posts from this blog or pics from my Instagram. The rest was new updates from my <em>Closed Friends</em>. Then I scrolled fast through my news feed to see anything interesting. Aside from <a href="http://dallarosa.tumblr.com/">my good friend</a>'s new hair style, nothing was really interesting. So basically, I didn't really miss anything significant. That is interesting.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/2y1h0Y1q1d3w3E3s2F1D/Screen%20Shot%202012-09-27%20at%209.47.56%20AM.png" alt="Twitter navigation tab" /></p>

<p>The second interesting thing was in Twitter. Specifically, in Twitter's web page. The first thing I wanted to do on Twitter was to see if any body <em>mentioned</em> me. Unlike Facebook, Twitter doesn't have the red notification bubble. But there was this blue light under the gear icon. So I figured that must be my notifications. But when I clicked it, there was only my Direct Messages. Ok, I still thought, so my Mention notification is not here. I figured maybe it's on the <em>Me</em> icon. I mean, it says Me, so that means everything that belongs to Me should be there, doesn't it? So I clicked it. To my surprise, it wasn't there as well. Where is my "Mentions"?! It can't be in that @Connect, can it? I thought @Connect is the place if you want to find some people to follow, to connect with other users, hence the name @Connect. But I was wrong. My mentions were there. That's interesting. Either me or Twitter don't understand user experience. Anyway, no important mentions after a week. I didn't look at my Twitter streams, cause I knew there must be tons of tweets.</p>

<p>I can say that I am a social network addict. But like everything else, having something excessively is never a good thing. From this one week experiment, I can conclude that once a week Twitter/Facebook consumption is good for my health. So if you have anything important to tell me, please don't do it via Facebook or Twitter. Just email me, or iMessage or text me. Thank you.</p>

<p>Note: Unfortunately, I cannot get away from Instagram. I just couldn't miss seeing Giee-tan for a day! I mean, look at her, she's the cutest cat in the world! ヽ(=^ ･ω･^ =)丿 Follow <a href="instagram://user?username=tiaichima">tiaichima</a> for more pics of Giee! (You have to open that link from your iPhone and must have instagram app installed).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Linden Tibbets on <a href="http://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> alerts email:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>In recent weeks, Twitter announced policy changes* that will affect how applications and users like yourself can interact with Twitter's data. As a result of these changes, on September 27th we will be removing all Twitter Triggers, disabling your ability to push tweets to places like email, Evernote and Facebook. All Personal and Shared Recipes using a Twitter Trigger will also be removed. Recipes using Twitter Actions and your ability to post new tweets via IFTTT will continue to work just fine.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>As a user, I thought I didn't really mind the changes in Twitter's policy. <!-- more -->
Well, I did feel disappointed when I couldn't use Tweetbot for Mac anymore, but there was still the web and the crappy official app. So I just let it pass.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/1P2b2R252y1j2c3t1Q3v/Screen%20Shot%202012-09-21%20at%208.50.20%20AM.png" alt="Tweetbot for Mac stopped working" /></p>

<p>Until today. For those who don't know, <a href="http://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> is an amazing service which can let the internet services you use to <em>talk</em> with each other. One of the <em>receipes</em> I used in IFTTT is to backup my tweets to my Dropbox. As you might know, it's really difficult to see your old tweets. Thus the backing up. However, with the Twitter's policy change, this won't be possible anymore. Very disappointing. Because the tweets I tweeted are my own. I should have the rights to do whatever I want to do with it.</p>

<p>Anyhow, as the wise man says, it's for FREE, if you don't like it, don't use it. As a matter of fact, I have reduced using Twitter directly. My tweets mostly came from Instagram or this blog using IFTTT.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Andrew Wulf on <a href="http://thecodist.com/article/i_39_m_sorry_but_the_revolution_in_smartphones_is_long_over">I'm sorry but the revolution in smartphones is long over</a>:
<blockquote><p>Will there ever be a real innovation in the smartphone market anytime soon? I doubt it. Maybe plugging into my brain directly (a scary concept) but I can't see anything remaining that would be a real game changer. Bigger and smaller phones are limited by biology. Thinner phones are very hard to make much thinner since you wind up limited by physics. Maybe flexible phones might be cool. Or foldable phones you can stick in your wallet. But making things too small runs into the issue of being easy to lose or break. So what's left? Windows 8 has an interesting take on UI but I'm not sure it's better, just different. If you try to take your UI too far away from the basic design in place (finger friendly) you might lose too many customers. Android, while partially open, can't move too far way in its UI or risk irritating customers. Simple is a tough thing to improve.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>A day before iPhone 5 event, me and wifey were talking about what could make people be amazed with Apple's announcement again.<!-- more -->
The announcement of the original iPhone seemed so exciting. It was revolutionary. A phone with apps, full touch screen, no keypads. Steve Jobs looked so <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uW-E496FXg">proud</a>. iPhone 4 brought a new excitement with the new design. More beautiful than its predecessors. Even more entertaining with <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5520471/the-tale-of-apples-next-iphone">the saga of the lost iPhone</a>. However, iPhone 4S didn't bring the original iPhone's level of excitement. Of course it was selling like crazy. It was the best phone at that time. And the white one? Deserved a 12-hour waiting in line under the rain in front of Apple Store, true story. Then came the iPhone 5, with so many leaks and rumors months before its launch. People lost their excitement already from the leaks. Didn't seem like anything new but the taller display.</p>

<p>Back to our discussion, we were thinking iPhone 4/4S has the most beautiful and well designed phone ever. We couldn't think of what kind of new design that could outmatch this phone. Simply changing the UI won't cut it. And I'm not really a fan of transparent display and elastic phone, seems hard to use. Phone plugged to the brain? NO WAY! So we asked ourselves, what do we use phone for anyway. Hardly making calls, some playing, some texting/posting/tweeting, and mostly reading. Is there a problem with reading on iPhone. Since retina display, no problem. Text never been that clear on a phone. But without a doubt, reading in Kindle is so much better and comfortable than that in iPhone. Therefore, our crazy idea that we think could make people go crazy with the iPhone was the ability to change the display of iPhone to the <em>Reading Mode</em>. With a press of a switch/button, the display can toggle between paper like display for reading and the LED backlit display. That would be revolutionary. But very unlikely.</p>

<p>Enough daydreaming. Back to work, back to work ...</p>
