    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am not living in US, but my twitter feeds, or Google Reader RSS is full of stories about the hurricane. And today some friends (who are not living in US either) in Facebook shared this amazing picture of the tornado forming over New York City near the statue of Liberty.</p>

<p>Being sceptical of me, I immediately dragged and dropped the image to Google Image Search (you do know that you can do this, right?) and there my suspicion got answered at the bottom of the search result page. Here is the <a href="https://www.google.co.jp/search?tbs=sbi:AMhZZivLXniAjEY_1P6q5anH15SQrhKeOwKAA4SrqEBn8dcVblkPpYeWNqk9G5KIalu8xqStmH4aIhYwGoG-O8um1GTsZcTHJw2mDj9Yny0Tiu8qogNv21sOlBeVTPEQb6g9_1hyya_1_1IwCuFumsBpuTaXYdwYUXaLo97Iiht81O0YWGs-eehu30eQ9DZTIUyNNdWjL0navf30DBaHD7woLqNTDa3cF-X0J04vnxPgwQ-LL4E5XVQEmMSy1m1FNFnmmeRt6dzMZp3LJFz7CnRXgKMC1W3M-OrZnnAPuNxm8KmNMXNG6SjOWlCLX7yZnY79A5q2oRZpztARx1UBjhSXrLHPQRMID551O87PRvBZXRpI3Ojx8HgCBXRMWOj_1tRo0gY6PF-OgCNOddMGNAyhc_1J2_1No4ixLwBpo-umqc358GwzvdavEG13z5OChPmzoCbnIX4JyUPwplULiMs4SRg4wEtOBKVo1ymLryNhgo7VrkCJ0Vf5vvrLaC7HRGIIccFjmG2V2PFl2ufLjogkku4t0fY7JI31foGAEifIRXTV8JRyLLr6xPjT63Gaz2UrKBNJaH3RdSyyR8V9kauE-uJb0qwYmnmFJ3v4GZRcSD7R0567e4272MkGNy7Xs_1TZH5vQw46qKW23BbQxiZIMBnVY5fb9QLaY33CnGnAL1Sqny4FgOEVIZ32okyu5y19LF0R0i_13Ut8bvTuwAeMDCi8xUSvluRbxrBSdOi7iBAZUCqp8j0JboCD5i2SYwZtqwaHH1rN59A9KSMxU-qt0BmbLwwUBfwcGwCKtzxZXOPcDQVR1t2QKFb2nRTW4-eB4WXhcauyRLTcxxp5SdkTi8ke9J9nciAP5Yja3yd4AWSKwP0_1ViBJIjOeS6iK5E6b548kz_1gRGGxWhUawz8kOmBOZNJqInShy0_1iCUmbZ-iVwk6oXjMgu_1ZWCVNrKW_1sD-82zY_1ZEt_1uuJmDPNik-Qtfm_1MD8An-6tkQk_1vSzIpIXqXy39vrTImYpIEcQfu_1SUgDuKgRIMWHzOVx-iVm_15FSXkvq0Np-K7O437oyaCooLJiJgDVDrC-0fRgNxPjOc9Iu7lRZL39qYOcUyL4QJIiNyj28k6BL20fqXvtqf4Ig83cMJoaFziPsrxrJj64PlyqTL7KCmF3b-AyGrDXjWBz-l7ZkXhV1_1fgSmLXK51A4MeKiKKFzITS_1zcgUhEggG6GETgP72_1Hjv_1yfPSywfEhR9WkeLV-VRGX3xIFUXVa2EMnLLLqtqTJJLUOk4utDlvBUz_117lUfI1ajqEpdOPK-rRPaOP3ajXszLXiJY5BFf6DY8FE3hFcmY0c9tsP6wcpgJEZ9elGVkitXofTR14ISChYN868SZUYMsqNpw&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=active&amp;bih=651&amp;biw=1360">link</a> to the search page for those who have no idea how to drag-and-drop image search in Google.</p>

<p>Yup, it's a <a href="http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/naturalwonders/ss/New-York-City-Tornado-Picture.htm">hoax</a>, as I expected. Guess how many seconds of my life I spent to check the authenticity of a viral content. Less than 10 seconds. Maybe you should give it a try before sharing something?</p>

<p>If you still cannot grasp what I mean, it's the crappy way of advertising the product by comparing with the competitor. At least do it in a funny and classy way like Mac vs PC.</p>

<p>It's hard not to notice from the two videos that Android users tend to show their <em>hatred/dislike</em> towards Apple, while on the other hand, Apple users tend to show their <em>love</em> towards Apple itself. Which is kind of weird since we all know that there was one person in Apple who hated Android so much.</p>

<p>I always see those who hate Apple as broken hearted people. It could be an unrequited love. Or it could be a relationship that went wrong at some point. Either way, they cannot help but bitching about Apple as a result of disappointment.</p>

<p>Android world needs more people who are proud of having an Android device than those who keep complaining about device that they are not going to use anyway.</p>

<p>Anyhow, We just looooooooooooooove Apple. ♡＾▽＾♡ Except the Apple Map. (¬д¬。)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/1v1O2A290s0k0p0r2A1t/ipadmini.jpg" alt="The iPad mini" /></p>

<p>First thing I did this morning when I woke up was to pick up my iPad which was lying on the side of my bed all night, opened Safari, typed in apple.com. iPad mini was the first thing I saw. Watching the video of the iPad mini, me and wifey thought, "we want it!" It looks lighter, and easier to hold.</p>

<p>But then, John Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/10/23/ipad-mini-dalrymple">said</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Screen resolution-wise, it’s exactly what I expected for a 163 PPI display in 2012: noticeably nicer than the 133 PPI iPad 1/2, noticeably worse than the 266 PPI iPad 3/4. The iPad Mini display seems brighter and to have better contrast than the iPhone 3GS display, but unsurprisingly, rendered text looks exactly like it does on the 3GS.</p></blockquote></p>

<p><strong>Rendered text looks exactly like it does on the 3GS</strong>. Now that's a turn off. The thing I like the most from iPhone 4/4S and the (not so) new iPad was the retina display which display text sharply. If this iPad mini cannot do that, I guess we'll wait for the next generation.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0W142R2S1J3B080O1A0b/imac.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then we watched the <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/october-2012/">keynote</a>. Tim Cook took the stage as usual. Boring. Then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Schiller">Phil Schiller </a>came in. We kinda like this guy. As my wife said, "Phil doesn't try to be Steve Jobs when he's on stage." I agreed with her. He showed the new 13" Macbook Pro with Retina Display, new Mac Mini, and then. <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/features/">The new iMac</a>. It's amazing. I was stunned. Very thin. Very beautiful. It deserves the title of the queen of the event.</p>

<p>But what excites me the most about this iMac is it feels Job-sy. First, it's unexpected. Nobody predicted this. Everybody was so busy talking about the iPad mini. No rumors (as far as I know) talked about the new iMac. It's the surprise that I have been missing from apple events since the first iPad. Second, Apple made a bold move by removing optical drive from this new iMac. iMac is a desktop computer. With many DVDs and Blu-rays still being sold these days, removing the optical drive from a desktop computer required the guts and courage only Jobs has. And Apple still has it. Good job. Your move, Samsung.</p>

<p><img src="http://mangapournous.m.a.pic.centerblog.net/050930180636_4.gif" alt="Oh, and the Fusion drive in the iMac, sounds so ballsy" /></p>

<p>Final thought, stil hoping for Macbook Air 11" with Retina display…</p>

<p>Some previous amusing works by Samsung's designers:</p>

<p>More <a href="http://samsungcopiesapple.tumblr.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>We all can call Samsung shameless copycat. But there's just no reason, but conscience, to stop executing this strategy. The worst that could happen to them was a mere <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/jury-returns-verdict-in-apple-v-samsung/">$1 billion</a>. Nothing compared to their <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/10/05/samsung-record-7-1-billion-profit/">$7.3 billion profit</a>.</p>

<p>This strategy just works.</p>
