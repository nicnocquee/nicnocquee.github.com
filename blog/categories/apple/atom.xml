<p>Long story short, I love iPad Mini. And I'm gonna love even more the next version of iPad Mini with Retina Display.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8192/8147068767_7a86db0a60.jpg" alt="Back of Mini" /></p>

<p>So I was about to write a post to respond to a friend's status update regarding Apple, but I remembered I have decided not to respond to any tweets, comments, updates, posts ridiculing Apple. It's a waste of time, energy, and soul. Furthermore, it's the poster's rights to say what he/she wants about anything. Although in this particular instance, he specifically asked Apple fans to read and understand. Which brought me to question the purpose of the status update. Because when I bad-mouthed Google, Amazon, Samsung, etc, I never ask the users of each company to read and understand. I have no agenda to convince the users to ditch the service/product. Since it is their right to choose and use whatever they want to use. I just spoke my mind. And who could say that the service or product that I endorse will be better for him/her. Or who could say that the service or product that I try to sell will stay good as it is now. I couldn't figure out his point.</p>

<p><img src="http://distilleryimage10.s3.amazonaws.com/02741656248d11e2a33422000a1ea02a_7.jpg" alt="The only line for iPad mini! So short!! #apple #shinsaibashi #osaka #kansai #japan" /></p>

<p>Anyway, today, in Japan, iPad Mini is available in the Apple Store. So I went to the only Apple Store in Osaka, Apple Store Shinsaibashi. As expected, there were no ridiculously long line for the iPad Mini. I just went to the store, tried the iPad Mini a little bit, went to the staff, paid, unboxed, and done. Very fast.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8188/8147068869_fd03a2c699.jpg" alt="Fits in my hand!" /></p>

<p>First impression, like many others who had the priviledge of playing with it in the US early, this thing is so freaking <strong>LIGHT</strong>! It fits perfectly on my hand. Very easy to use with one hand. Even without the retina display, it feels comfortable for reading.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8468/8147104266_a35cdc212a.jpg" alt="Easy to hold" /></p>

<p>Typing on iPad Mini was also giving a good impression. If you have used the big bro iPad, you'll notice that it's not so easy to type on it while standing. But typing on iPad Mini is a joy.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8335/8147069177_5751c1d112.jpg" alt="Retina display please" /></p>

<p>iPad Mini + Macbook Air 11" is the best combo for me for now. Once both get enhanced with Retina Display, it will be perfect.</p>

<p>So which color did you get?</p>

<p>If you still cannot grasp what I mean, it's the crappy way of advertising the product by comparing with the competitor. At least do it in a funny and classy way like Mac vs PC.</p>

<p>It's hard not to notice from the two videos that Android users tend to show their <em>hatred/dislike</em> towards Apple, while on the other hand, Apple users tend to show their <em>love</em> towards Apple itself. Which is kind of weird since we all know that there was one person in Apple who hated Android so much.</p>

<p>I always see those who hate Apple as broken hearted people. It could be an unrequited love. Or it could be a relationship that went wrong at some point. Either way, they cannot help but bitching about Apple as a result of disappointment.</p>

<p>Android world needs more people who are proud of having an Android device than those who keep complaining about device that they are not going to use anyway.</p>

<p>Anyhow, We just looooooooooooooove Apple. ♡＾▽＾♡ Except the Apple Map. (¬д¬。)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/1v1O2A290s0k0p0r2A1t/ipadmini.jpg" alt="The iPad mini" /></p>

<p>First thing I did this morning when I woke up was to pick up my iPad which was lying on the side of my bed all night, opened Safari, typed in apple.com. iPad mini was the first thing I saw. Watching the video of the iPad mini, me and wifey thought, "we want it!" It looks lighter, and easier to hold.</p>

<p>But then, John Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/10/23/ipad-mini-dalrymple">said</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Screen resolution-wise, it’s exactly what I expected for a 163 PPI display in 2012: noticeably nicer than the 133 PPI iPad 1/2, noticeably worse than the 266 PPI iPad 3/4. The iPad Mini display seems brighter and to have better contrast than the iPhone 3GS display, but unsurprisingly, rendered text looks exactly like it does on the 3GS.</p></blockquote></p>

<p><strong>Rendered text looks exactly like it does on the 3GS</strong>. Now that's a turn off. The thing I like the most from iPhone 4/4S and the (not so) new iPad was the retina display which display text sharply. If this iPad mini cannot do that, I guess we'll wait for the next generation.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0W142R2S1J3B080O1A0b/imac.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then we watched the <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/october-2012/">keynote</a>. Tim Cook took the stage as usual. Boring. Then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Schiller">Phil Schiller </a>came in. We kinda like this guy. As my wife said, "Phil doesn't try to be Steve Jobs when he's on stage." I agreed with her. He showed the new 13" Macbook Pro with Retina Display, new Mac Mini, and then. <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/features/">The new iMac</a>. It's amazing. I was stunned. Very thin. Very beautiful. It deserves the title of the queen of the event.</p>

<p>But what excites me the most about this iMac is it feels Job-sy. First, it's unexpected. Nobody predicted this. Everybody was so busy talking about the iPad mini. No rumors (as far as I know) talked about the new iMac. It's the surprise that I have been missing from apple events since the first iPad. Second, Apple made a bold move by removing optical drive from this new iMac. iMac is a desktop computer. With many DVDs and Blu-rays still being sold these days, removing the optical drive from a desktop computer required the guts and courage only Jobs has. And Apple still has it. Good job. Your move, Samsung.</p>

<p>Final thought, stil hoping for Macbook Air 11" with Retina display…</p>
