    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are many <a href="blog/2014/09/28/25-must-have-apps-for-your-mac/">amazing tools to help iOS development</a> easier. One of them is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/paintcode-2/id808809998?l=en&amp;mt=12&amp;at=11lMiE">PaintCode</a>. A splendid tool to turn drawings into code. But what about animation? It would be very helpful if there is a tool to create animations visually and turn them into code. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quartzcode-vector-animation/id913523893?ls=1&amp;mt=12&amp;at=11lMiE">QuartzCode</a> is the answer.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I gave it a try by trying to replicate the cute uploading animation I found in <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1429143-Upload?list=buckets&amp;offset=14">Dribbble</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/50261/screenshots/1429143/upload.gif" alt="cute uploading animation" /></p>

<p>While it&#8217;s not completely the same, I managed to come up with something close enough after playing with QuartzCode for few hours.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicnocquee/FluidProgressIndicator/master/NPRUploadAnimation/files/demo-0.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>QuartzCode surely improves development speed once you get used to it. However it&#8217;s not quite perfect right now since there are some frustrating bugs which I hope will be fixed in the future:</p>

<ol>
<li>The undo function doesn&#8217;t work properly sometimes. Especially for paths.</li>
<li>Inspector panel and Keyframe inspector panel are unscrollable which probably is caused by Yosemite.</li>
<li>The generated code is buggy. Xcode warns a retail cycle, variable redefinition, etc.</li>
</ol>


<p>Regardless, by tweaking the generated code and by learning that we can <a href="http://ronnqvi.st/controlling-animation-timing/">control the animation timing</a>, I could create a lovely upload progress control.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicnocquee/FluidProgressIndicator/master/NPRUploadAnimation/files/demo-1.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can check out the project in <a href="https://github.com/nicnocquee/FluidProgressIndicator">Github</a> along with the <a href="https://github.com/nicnocquee/FluidProgressIndicator/tree/master/NPRUploadAnimation/files">QuartzCode project</a>.</p>

<p>QuartzCode is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quartzcode-vector-animation/id913523893?ls=1&amp;mt=12&amp;at=11lMiE">$79.99 on the Mac App Store</a> or you can try it first for free by downloading it from the <a href="http://www.quartzcodeapp.com">website</a>. Don&#8217;t forget to take a look at pretty cool examples on the website to find out what you can make with QuartzCode.</p>

    <link href="http://www.nicnocquee.com/blog/2014/09/22/nsattributedstring-with-nsstrikethroughstyleattributename-bug-in-ios-8/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In iOS 7, it&#8217;s easy to create UILabel with strikethrough text. You can just simply assign <code>NSAttributedString</code> to the text label.</p>

<!--more-->


<pre><code class="objc">    NSString *price = @"7,500";
    NSString *retailPrice = @"10,000ÂÜÜ";
    NSString *text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@ %@", price, retailPrice];
    NSMutableAttributedString *string = [[NSMutableAttributedString alloc] initWithString:text];
    [string addAttributes:@{NSStrikethroughStyleAttributeName:@(NSUnderlineStyleSingle)} range:[text rangeOfString:retailPrice]];
    [self.label setAttributedText:string];
</code></pre>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/1s1g3A3Z070n0u1k2t2W/iOS%20Simulator%20Screen%20Shot%20Sep%2022,%202014,%2020.11.27.png" alt="nsattributedstring-ios-8-bug" /></p>

<p>But in iOS 8, that code didn&#8217;t work anymore. The strikethrough line didn&#8217;t appear. Funny thing was, if range&#8217;s location is set to 0, or strikethrough from the beginning, the line appeared. To fix this you just have to assign the strikethrough attribute, <code>NSUnderlineStyleNone</code> to the whole string on initialization.</p>

<pre><code class="objc">    NSMutableAttributedString *string = [[NSMutableAttributedString alloc] initWithString:text attributes:@{NSStrikethroughStyleAttributeName: @(NSUnderlineStyleNone)}];
    [string addAttributes:@{NSStrikethroughStyleAttributeName:@(NSUnderlineStyleSingle)} range:[text rangeOfString:retailPrice]];

<p>Don&#8217;t be satisfied yet.</p>

<pre><code class="objc">    reversed = sorted(names, { s1, s2 in return s1 &gt; s2 } )

<p>You didn&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the best we can do, right?</p>

<p>Shorter!</p>

<p>You can do it!</p>

<pre><code class="objc">    reversed = sorted(names, &gt;)

<p>Use the force!</p>

<pre><code class="objc">    üòÑ=sorted(üê∑,&gt;)

<p>There! We have the winner! Oh, if you see two rectangles on the code above, use Safari or  Firefox, please :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BtGz0bLIMAA0UEk.jpg" alt="Comic I made when I was in master course" /></p>

<p>My first app was a bingo game. Prior to that, I had only learned Java in college. Before learning Java, I always thought that software was the result of magic. When I entered master course in Japan, I was coding sloppily in C for research. Mostly playing with <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">GNU Scientific Library</a>. I didn&#8217;t have a Mac nor iPhone. I even teased my friend who used OSX on his laptop back in college.</p>

<!--more-->


<p><img src="http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/234/765/b7e.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>A year passed by since I took master course and I still had no idea what I was doing. Then I stumbled upon an article by <a href="http://www.dannychoo.com">Danny Choo</a> about his passion and how he started his career. I can&#8217;t recall which article it was but probably this article about <a href="http://www.dannychoo.com/en/post/1691/Pursue+Your+Passion+A+Summary.html">pursuing passion</a> or this article about <a href="http://www.dannychoo.com/en/post/26094/How+Discovering+Japan+Changed+My+Life.html">how discovering Japan changed his life</a>. Reading about his life got me thinking that I needed to find something I&#8217;m passionate about. After digging through more articles on his website, I saw his iMac. I was amazed by how beautiful it was. I ended up buying one for myself. My very first Apple product.</p>

<p>One day in the class room, I saw my Japanese friend was playing with his shiny black phone. I was interested so I asked if I could take a look. There was only one button. And it has this slide to unlock mechanism. Mind. Blown. It was iPhone 3GS. My very first iPhone.</p>

<p>Having free time and lack of interest in what I was doing at that time, I decided to get the Apple Developer Program. Learning Objective-C, submitting my first app, and receiving my first payment from the App Store admittedly changed my life. I decided to quit my PhD and took a job in a startup in Japan as an iOS developer.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m writing this to support <a href="http://appdocumentary.com">App: The Human Story</a>. I didn&#8217;t plan to write anything since I figured my story is not that exciting. I haven&#8217;t made any hit game or app like Flappy Bird. But I&#8217;m making a living doing what I&#8217;m passionate about and I want to share it with others. I&#8217;m also pretty proud of the app I&#8217;m making for the company, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/monoco-monoko-akusesarinoserekutoshoppu/id539376693?mt=8">Monoco (Japan App Store only)</a>, and my own latest app, <a href="http://www.getdelightfulapp.com">Delightful</a>.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re an app developer, help them to reach their goal in <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/appdocu/app-the-human-story">kickstarter</a> and spread the word. It seems like it&#8217;s gonna be an interesting documentary.</p>

    <id>http://www.nicnocquee.com/blog/2014/06/26/script-to-download-wwdc-2014-videos</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/2m2M471z1O072F1F0B2u/Screen%20Shot%202014-06-26%20at%2023.54.57.png" alt="Script to download wwdc 14 videos" /></p>

<p>Although I&#8217;ll be most likely sleeping, I&#8217;m planning to catch up with WWDC 14 videos and watch some on the plane this weekend. I can easily download the videos via WWDC app. However they&#8217;ll eat up my iPhone&#8217;s free space. And I also want to speed up the videos a little bit. But downloading the videos one by one from the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/">download page</a> is too barbaric.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>There must be a script to download them all in one click. Google top search result returns this <a href="https://github.com/ohoachuck/wwdc-downloader">wwdc-downloader</a>, this <a href="http://samwize.com/2014/06/06/download-all-wwdc-2014-pdf-slides-only/">script to download PDF only or the HD videos</a>, and <a href="http://andrewcook.org/2014/06/07/download-wwdc-2014-videos/">this script to download the SD videos</a>. But for some reasons they didn&#8217;t work.</p>

<p>With a slight modification to those last two scripts, I managed to download the SD videos.</p>

<pre><code class="bash">    curl https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/ | grep -iIoh '|.*http.*._sd_.*dl=1' | sed -e 's/|.*"//g' | sed -e 's/\?dl=1//g'|xargs -n1 curl --remote-name
</code></pre>

<p>Then to speed up the videos by 1.3x, I used ffmpeg.</p>

<pre><code class="bash">    find . -name '*.mov' -exec ffmpeg -i {} -filter_complex "[0:v]setpts=10/13*PTS[v];[0:a]atempo=1.3[a]" -map "[v]" -map "[a]" {}@2x.mov \;
</code></pre>
