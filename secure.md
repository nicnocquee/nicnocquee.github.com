If you're familiar with PGP/GPG, you can skip next passages and download my [public key](https://keybase.io/nico_p/key.asc) from [Keybase.io](https://keybase.io/nico_p).

Email is not secure
--

Here's the thing about email, **it's not secure**. The e-mails you sent pass through many nodes in the network in plain text. It means anybody who wants to know what you wrote can read it (with extra effort of course). Even the email service you use like Gmail or Yahoo! Mail scans your emails and show ads based on them. *Just because you need to log in to the website to read or send your email it doesn't mean that your emails are secured.*

I have nothing to hide
--

Stop saying that. It's embarrassing. If you really have nothing to hide, just like Glenn Greenwald, I ask you to send me passwords to your social network and emails.

{% blockquote Glenn Greenwald | Why privacy matters - TED Talk | http://www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters %}
Over the last 16 months, as I've debated this issue around the world, every single time somebody has said to me, "I don't really worry about invasions of privacy because I don't have anything to hide." I always say the same thing to them. I get out a pen, I write down my email address. I say, "Here's my email address. What I want you to do when you get home is email me the passwords to all of your email accounts, not just the nice, respectable work one in your name, but all of them, because I want to be able to just troll through what it is you're doing online, read what I want to read and publish whatever I find interesting. After all, if you're not a bad person, if you're doing nothing wrong, you should have nothing to hide." Not a single person has taken me up on that offer.

Encryption for the greater good
--

You may think that you don't need privacy. But by encrypting your messages, you actually will help those who need privacy the most, like whistle-blowers and activists. If they are the only ones who use encryption, the mass surveillance systems could easily single them out. But *if everyone is using encryption for more things, if encryption is the norm, it will make it harder for the surveillance systems to distinguish a highly sensitive information.* After all, [encryption has made historical events possible](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/crypto-everyone-and-american-history-proves-it).

Send me encrypted email
--

To encrypt and secure our messages, use PGP/GPG and my [public key](https://keybase.io/nico_p/key.asc). I have verified myself via [Keybase.io](https://keybase.io/nico_p). All you have to do is to download [my public key](https://keybase.io/nico_p/key.asc) and import it to your computer using OpenPGP software. Below you'll find a list of possible solutions for your operating system:

- OS X	[https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-use-pgp-mac-os-x](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-use-pgp-mac-os-x)
- Linux	[https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-use-pgp-linux](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-use-pgp-linux)
- Windows	[https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-use-pgp-windows-pc](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-use-pgp-windows-pc)
- iOS		[https://itunes.apple.com/app/ipgmail/id430780873?mt=8](https://itunes.apple.com/app/ipgmail/id430780873?mt=8)
- Android	[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain)

However, if you're lazy to install new software in your computer, you can simply go to [Keybase Encrypt Page](https://keybase.io/encrypt), type `nico_p` in Recipient,  type your message, then click `Encrypt`. After that simply copy paste and send it to me. (Unfortunately I won't be able to reply securely to you this way if I don't have your publick key).


Email + PGP/GPG is not good enough
--

While using PGP/GPG with email is better than no encryption at all, it is still not the best solution. No forward secrecy is only one of the [many problems with PGP+email](http://secushare.org/PGP). While there are many end-to-end encrypted messaging apps appearing lately, like [Wire](https://wire.com), [Signal](https://whispersystems.org/#page-top), etc, I still haven't found the best, easy-to-use, and free solution for long form messaging, like email. If you have recommendation, let me know.
