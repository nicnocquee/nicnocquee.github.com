          <p>I received an email from Amazon Web Service notifying me that there were suspicious unauthorized activities in my account. Apparently my access key was exposed. It happened because I made public one of my private repos, one of the side projects I started and abandoned months ago, in which I <em>stupidly</em> left the AWS access key.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The unauthorized person(s) created 20 Windows instances on each of regions. By the time I received the e-mail notification from AWS, those instances had been running for about two hours. I deleted the exposed access key, and turned off all the instances as soon as possible. Not soon enough unfortunately since I got another email 4 hours after the incident alerting my usage billing exceeded 50 USD (the number I set up). Way over 50 USD. Let&#39;s just say it completely ruined my excitement of Apple Keynote.</p>

<h2>Bad people are EVERYWHERE</h2>

<p>This incident has given me a chance to understand how the celebrities might feel when their private photos were <em>stolen</em> lately. I said &quot;stolen&quot; because the celebrities did not upload their photos voluntarily to public space. Somebody broke into their personal online space and took their private files without the owner&#39;s permission. Would you blame yourself for keeping money at home when someone broke into your house and stole your money?</p>

<p>My case was not exactly the same since I <em>accidentally</em> exposed the key to my online space. But good people would not enter your house when they find your key lying on the ground. It reminds me when I forgot my room&#39;s key and left it hanging on the door a long time ago here in Japan. My neighbor, with whom I never talked, kept the key and returned it to me. That was how good people behave.</p>

<h2>Mistake as an experience</h2>

<p>I always have a hard time to come up with an answer for my own hypothetical question: What is your biggest mistake or unfortunate event in life? I can now proudly answer that this incident was my biggest mistake yet. Even so, I realized that this unfortunate event is nothing compared with all the terrible things happening all around the world right now.</p>

<h2>Lessons learned</h2>

<p>As obvious as it seems, I learned few things from this mishap. </p>

<ol>
<li>Never ever expose your key.</li>
<li>Act swiftly upon receiving suspicious activities alert.</li>
<li>Delete keys if you&#39;re not using them anymore.</li>
</ol>

<h2>A glimpse of hope</h2>

<p>When I woke up this morning, I found another email from Amazon replying to my plea to refund or to cancel the excessive billing. They said they will monitor my account for 24 hours prior to submitting a refund request on my behalf. Crossing fingers now. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE September 11, 2014</strong></p>

<p>Amazon just contacted me that as a one-time exception, they&#39;ll fully refund the bill! d=(´▽｀)=b</p>
