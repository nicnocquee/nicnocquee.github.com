Working on Delightful app on the side is kinda mentally torturing. Like recently for example. There are many things I want to implement in Delightful app but I need to postpone because I have to work on my day job app, Monoco. But my brain cannot stop thinking about what I will do with Delightful. It's so hard to concentrate on both.
