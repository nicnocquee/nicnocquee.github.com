I was just wondering out of the blue if I could delete and deactivate all my Google search history. Turns out it's easy. All you have to do is to go to your account's [activity control page](https://myaccount.google.com/privacy), and turn off the `Your searches and browsing activity` setting to stop Google from saving your Google search activities.

To delete the search history, click on `Manage Activity`, click the three vertical dots button on the top right corner of the page, and click the `Delete Options`. After that, choose the `Advanced` option and choose `All time` to delete all the searches.

Enjoy searching safely in Google from now on! You can also disable other tracking settings, such as Location history, in your account page. I'm curious about how my Google experience will be now that I disable the search history setting. This could be the last time I could see my search activity insight. Thank you, Stackoverflow!
