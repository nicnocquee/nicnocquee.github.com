They said people change. And it's certainly so in my case. I used to be excited at new things or ideas. But not so much lately. New single-word messaging app? Seriously? New shiny digital watch? Meh. New anonymous social networking? Another one? Every new project or startup sounds so dull, stupid, and unnecessary. Even my own ideas.

Today somebody tweeted an article by Jason Fried, [Give it five minutes](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes).

> There are two things in this world that take no skill: 1. Spending other people’s money and 2. Dismissing an idea.

Funny thing is that I read this article before. And I forgot. And I am now reminded again.

> So next time you hear something, or someone, talk about an idea, pitch an idea, or suggest an idea, give it five minutes. Think about it a little bit before pushing back, before saying it’s too hard or it’s too much work. Those things may be true, but there may be another truth in there too: It may be worth it.
