Really love this new song from Kelly. But unfortunately, RCA Records doesn't want my money by making this song not available in Japan iTunes. Good job, RCA.

I always wonder why contents cannot be **free** of geographical constrain. Not only songs like this Kelly's song, but also books. For example, you cannot find popular books in Japan iBooks Store. I am pretty sure it's not because of the request Is it because of legal stuffs? Tax? Government rules?
