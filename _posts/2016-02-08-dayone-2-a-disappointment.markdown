I've been using Day One for a long time on iOS and Mac. My wife is also using it. I once sent a feature request to allow multiple photos on an entry and the team behind Day One replied and told me they would include that in Day One 2.

That's why I was so excited when they finally announced Day One 2. I was a little bit surprised with the 50% discount launch price, $19.99 for Mac and $4.99 for iOS. I thought it was a little bit pricey but I understood that it's hard to make money in the App Store so I bought them anyway.

I should've read thoroughly about the upgrade before purchasing it because it turned out to be a disappointment. The first surprise I encountered was the lack of Dropbox support. They decided to dispose Dropbox and iCloud sync in favor of their own syncing service. I never had a problem using Dropbox to sync my Day One entries so I'm not so happy with this feature. While [Dropbox is not entirely secure](https://www.dropbox.com/help/27), at least it has two-step verification while Day One 2 doesn't have. It's not even in their [todo list](http://help.dayoneapp.com/day-one-2-0-faq/).

After using the iOS app for a while, I found out that I cannot set a journal entry's date to the taken date of a photo anymore. This is a setback from Day One Classic. The iOS app also suffers from choppy scrolling in the `All Entries` tab and the photos picker on my iPhone 6plus. And the UI-blocking weather fetch is still around. (_C'mon, fetch weather info in the background. Don't block the main thread!_)

I realize some people are using Day One differently from me and maybe the new features in Day One 2 satisfy them. But all I wanted was the ability to add multiple photos in a journal entry. I got what I asked for. But I lost what I've been using and gained things I don't need.

If I'd asked customers what they wanted, they would have said "a faster horse".

Take a look at [what other features they are going to release in the near  future](http://help.dayoneapp.com/day-one-2-0-faq/). _Encryption_ is the only feature I need. And it's not even the top priority. I really just wanted a _faster horse_.

I hope they will fix the bugs ASAP because I'm a fan of Day One. It is one of the apps I'm using daily.
