<p>Recently, I see a trend of what I call <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a> style of blogging. I called it that way just because John Gruber&#8217;s blog was the first one I saw using that style. Using DF style, every post is short. There&#8217;s always a quote from other article and accompanied by comment from the blogger. Sometimes a long comment. Most of the time very short, like <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/01/22/rim">one word only</a>. It doesn&#8217;t seem like a hard thing to do. And the rumor even said that <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/daring-fireball-2011-3">John earned a ton of cash</a> from his blog.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m so amazed by people who are constantly updating their blogs with new posts. Even more amazed by those who make money and make a living out of blogging. Because I find blogging a hard thing to do. It takes lots of thinking and time. What to write. How to write it. Search for other articles that can backup what you wrote. Which is why I think Twitter and Facebook became so popular. You don&#8217;t really think to tweet or post to Facebook.</p>

<p>So the point of this post is â€¦ nothing actually. I just saw the comic strip above from <a href="http://www.shoeboxblog.com/?p=32420">shoeboxblog.com</a> and it made me want to express my opinion on how hard blogging is. Of course I can simply say in Twitter or Facebook, &#8220;Blogging is hard&#8221;. But I&#8217;m in the middle of Facebook/Twitter fasting. What&#8217;s that? Next time. Be patient young Jedi.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using many blogging services. Started with Wordpress, Blogger, Tumblr and most recent one was Posterous. I was satisfied with Posterous, until Twitter acquired them. For some reason, the posts I sent via email got published hours after I sent them. Asked them via Twitter about this but no response. So I figured it is time to move on.</p>

<p>Going forward, I&#8217;m going to use <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>+<a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> for blogging. Not really easy to setup, but seems cool. And this is the first post. I thought simply posting &#8220;Hello world&#8221; or &#8220;This is my first post&#8221; will be so boring. So I share with you a video from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/davidmitchellsoapbox?feature=watch">David Mitchell</a>. I mean, just for his voice this video has to be shared.</p>

<p>Until next time.</p>
