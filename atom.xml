    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>September 9 2014 Apple Live Event was not my favorite Apple&#8217;s event. I&#8217;ll even say that it was the <em>worst</em> Apple event ever. I haven&#8217;t rewatched the keynote (probably never will) and haven&#8217;t read any reviews of the keynote. So here&#8217;s my review.</p>

<!--more-->


<ol>
<li>Tim Cook decided to hold the event in a different place from where they usually did in the past. This resulted in a terrible streaming quality where I completely missed what&#8217;s so great about the new iPhones.</li>
<li>Apple was trying to explain to developers that they should have <code>Localizable.strings (Chinese)</code> file in their app by hiring a Chinese lady to speak non-stop louder than Phil Schiller.</li>
<li>iPhone 6 is amazing. Freeze. Claps. Mute.  Repeat.</li>
<li>Tim Cook disappointed when nobody recognized the voice of Justin Timberlake.</li>
<li>Something exciting about paying things with iPhone. In US only. Because other countries are secondary. Except China. China got the unstoppable live translation.</li>
<li>PAY still means you <em>need</em> to pay for things you buy.</li>
<li>Jony Ive had pimples problem that they removed him from his white room prison.</li>
<li>Apple brought &#8220;One More Thing&#8221; back from the grave.</li>
<li>Apple revealed a watch because that&#8217;s what society needs right now.</li>
<li>iTime? iWatch? iPrefixIsSoLastYearThatWeChooseUnicodeSymbolAsPrefixFromNowOn.</li>
<li>Digital Crown on WATCH (ALL CAPITAL, PLEASE) because calling it <em>Dial</em> sounds so cheap.</li>
<li>An ex-Adobe Bill Gates doppelgänger demoed WATCH where he hardly use the <em>innovative</em> Digital Crown and touch the screen most of the time instead. Tim will be pissed.</li>
<li>Apple invented new way of communication without words via the WATCH. Because F__K words. Pre-historic way of communicating is the trend of the future.</li>
<li>YOUTUBE ON STAGE! Oh, it&#8217;s U2. Misheard thanks to poor quality streaming.</li>
<li>Tim Cook and U2 slapstick was so bad that everyone wished the Chinese lady started talking again.</li>
<li>FREE U2 ALBUM FOR EVERYONE! Not sure if you can delete it from your iTunes library though.</li>
<li>That white structure? Yeah, nothing special about it.</li>
</ol>


<p>I think the Reality Distortion Field has worn off on me.</p>

    <updated>2014-09-10T01:43:18+09:00</updated>
    <id>http://nicnocquee.com/blog/2014/09/10/costly-mistake</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I received an email from Amazon Web Service notifying me that there were suspicious unauthorized activities in my account. Apparently my access key was exposed. It happened because I made public one of my private repos, one of the side projects I started and abandoned months ago, in which I <em>stupidly</em> left the AWS access key.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The unauthorized person(s) created 20 Windows instances on each of regions. By the time I received the e-mail notification from AWS, those instances had been running for about two hours. I deleted the exposed access key, and turned off all the instances as soon as possible. Not soon enough unfortunately since I got another email 4 hours after the incident alerting my usage billing exceeded 50 USD (the number I set up). Way over 50 USD. Let&#8217;s just say it completely ruined my excitement of Apple Keynote.</p>

<h2>Bad people are EVERYWHERE</h2>

<p>This incident has given me a chance to understand how the celebrities might feel when their private photos were <em>stolen</em> lately. I said &#8220;stolen&#8221; because the celebrities did not upload their photos voluntarily to public space. Somebody broke into their personal online space and took their private files without the owner&#8217;s permission. Would you blame yourself for keeping money at home when someone broke into your house and stole your money?</p>

<p>My case was not exactly the same since I <em>accidentally</em> exposed the key to my online space. But good people would not enter your house when they find your key lying on the ground. It reminds me when I forgot my room&#8217;s key and left it hanging on the door a long time ago here in Japan. My neighbor, with whom I never talked, kept the key and returned it to me. That was how good people behave.</p>

<h2>Mistake as an experience</h2>

<p>I always have a hard time to come up with an answer for my own hypothetical question: What is your biggest mistake or unfortunate event in life? I can now proudly answer that this incident was my biggest mistake yet. Even so, I realized that this unfortunate event is nothing compared with all the terrible things happening all around the world right now.</p>

<h2>Lessons learned</h2>

<p>As obvious as it seems, I learned few things from this mishap.</p>

<ol>
<li>Never ever expose your key.</li>
<li>Act swiftly upon receiving suspicious activities alert.</li>
</ol>


<h2>A glimpse of hope</h2>

<p>When I woke up this morning, I found another email from Amazon replying to my plea to refund or to cancel the excessive billing. They said they will monitor my account for 24 hours prior to submitting a refund request on my behalf. Crossing fingers now.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BtGz0bLIMAA0UEk.jpg" alt="Comic I made when I was in master course" /></p>

<p>My first app was a bingo game. Prior to that, I had only learned Java in college. Before learning Java, I always thought that software was the result of magic. When I entered master course in Japan, I was coding sloppily in C for research. Mostly playing with <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">GNU Scientific Library</a>. I didn&#8217;t have a Mac nor iPhone. I even teased my friend who used OSX on his laptop back in college.</p>

<!--more-->


<p><img src="http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/234/765/b7e.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>A year passed by since I took master course and I still had no idea what I was doing. Then I stumbled upon an article by <a href="http://www.dannychoo.com">Danny Choo</a> about his passion and how he started his career. I can&#8217;t recall which article it was but probably this article about <a href="http://www.dannychoo.com/en/post/1691/Pursue+Your+Passion+A+Summary.html">pursuing passion</a> or this article about <a href="http://www.dannychoo.com/en/post/26094/How+Discovering+Japan+Changed+My+Life.html">how discovering Japan changed his life</a>. Reading about his life got me thinking that I needed to find something I&#8217;m passionate about. After digging through more articles on his website, I saw his iMac. I was amazed by how beautiful it was. I ended up buying one for myself. My very first Apple product.</p>

<p>One day in the class room, I saw my Japanese friend was playing with his shiny black phone. I was interested so I asked if I could take a look. There was only one button. And it has this slide to unlock mechanism. Mind. Blown. It was iPhone 3GS. My very first iPhone.</p>

<p>Having free time and lack of interest in what I was doing at that time, I decided to get the Apple Developer Program. Learning Objective-C, submitting my first app, and receiving my first payment from the App Store admittedly changed my life. I decided to quit my PhD and took a job in a startup in Japan as an iOS developer.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m writing this to support <a href="http://appdocumentary.com">App: The Human Story</a>. I didn&#8217;t plan to write anything since I figured my story is not that exciting. I haven&#8217;t made any hit game or app like Flappy Bird. But I&#8217;m making a living doing what I&#8217;m passionate about and I want to share it with others. I&#8217;m also pretty proud of the app I&#8217;m making for the company, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/monoco-monoko-akusesarinoserekutoshoppu/id539376693?mt=8">Monoco (Japan App Store only)</a>, and my own latest app, <a href="http://www.getdelightfulapp.com">Delightful</a>.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re an app developer, help them to reach their goal in <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/appdocu/app-the-human-story">kickstarter</a> and spread the word. It seems like it&#8217;s gonna be an interesting documentary.</p>

    <id>http://nicnocquee.com/blog/2014/06/26/script-to-download-wwdc-2014-videos</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/2m2M471z1O072F1F0B2u/Screen%20Shot%202014-06-26%20at%2023.54.57.png" alt="Script to download wwdc 14 videos" /></p>

<p>Although I&#8217;ll be most likely sleeping, I&#8217;m planning to catch up with WWDC 14 videos and watch some on the plane this weekend. I can easily download the videos via WWDC app. However they&#8217;ll eat up my iPhone&#8217;s free space. And I also want to speed up the videos a little bit. But downloading the videos one by one from the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/">download page</a> is too barbaric.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>There must be a script to download them all in one click. Google top search result returns this <a href="https://github.com/ohoachuck/wwdc-downloader">wwdc-downloader</a>, this <a href="http://samwize.com/2014/06/06/download-all-wwdc-2014-pdf-slides-only/">script to download PDF only or the HD videos</a>, and <a href="http://andrewcook.org/2014/06/07/download-wwdc-2014-videos/">this script to download the SD videos</a>. But for some reasons they didn&#8217;t work.</p>

<p>With a slight modification to those last two scripts, I managed to download the SD videos.</p>

<pre><code>curl https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/ | grep -iIoh '|.*http.*._sd_.*dl=1' | sed -e 's/|.*"//g' | sed -e 's/\?dl=1//g'|xargs -n1 curl --remote-name
</code></pre>

<p>Then to speed up the videos by 1.3x, I used ffmpeg.</p>

<pre><code>find . -name '*.mov' -exec ffmpeg -i {} -filter_complex "[0:v]setpts=10/13*PTS[v];[0:a]atempo=1.3[a]" -map "[v]" -map "[a]" {}@2x.mov \;
</code></pre>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I found out about <a href="http://icomoon.io/">icomoon</a> and was wondering how to use the icon fonts on Mac. Turns out it&#8217;s not so difficult.</p>

<p>Skipt this steps if you already have icon fonts.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://icomoon.io/app/">icomoon app</a>, select some fonts. (Tip: You can drag and select multiple fonts quickly.)</li>
<li>Generate the font then download.</li>
<li>Install the downloaded icomoon.ttf font by double clicking it.</li>
</ol>


<!-- more -->


<p>Now the fun part.</p>

<ol>
<li>Open System Preferences.</li>
<li>Select Language &amp; Text.</li>
<li>Check Unicode Hex Input in Input Source.</li>
</ol>


<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3I3s2v121n3d1i2r311Z/Screen%20Shot%202013-10-16%20at%207.08.13%20PM.png" alt="Unicode Hex Input in System Preferences OS X" /></p>

<p>That&#8217;s it! Well not quite. The secret to use the font is <strong>by choosing Unicode Hex Input from Input menu in menu bar, then type the unicode code while pressing Option (⌥) key</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0a1x2q2I3K3L1J05472Z/Screen%20Shot%202013-10-16%20at%206.45.42%20PM.png" alt="Change Input from Menu bar" /></p>

<p>So for example, to insert ♥, while pressing Option, type 2665. (Option+2665). The same goes for icon fonts generated by icomoon. Insert the unicde character then change the font to icomoon font.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0D2c3Z1W2d0M163D3g3k/Screen%20Shot%202013-10-16%20at%206.50.25%20PM.png" alt="Insert unicode and use custom icon font in Pixelmator" /></p>

<p>Now have fun with custom icon fonts!</p>

<p>One of my hobby is to star or clone open source iOS components/libraries in Github. There are just many good open source projects there that can speed up app development. And I&#8217;m pretty sure many apps in the app store are using these open source libraries. Unfortunately, most apps don&#8217;t act like good open source citizens by not showing the attributions.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Some big name apps show the attributions in the app. Facebook for example. You can find it in Settings -> Facebook -> Settings -> About. There are many libraries they listed there. But some libraries seem to be server-side libraries. The iOS-related open source libraries (as for version 183159) are</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-toolbox-for-mac/">Google Toolbox for Mac</a>. I&#8217;ve never used this. Anything insteresting there?</li>

    <updated>2013-04-06T00:08:00+09:00</updated>
    <id>http://nicnocquee.com/blog/2013/04/06/osx-fun-with-terminal</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/1c3C0z0t1g0e2K1y2X0M/Screen%20Shot%202013-04-06%20at%2012.00.21%20AM.png" alt="Customize OSX Terminal" /></p>

<p>Some fun things you can do to pimp your OSX Terminal: (I&#8217;m using Mountain Lion fyi)</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Customize Terminal Prompt with Emoji</h2>

<p>Add this line to ~/.bash_profile (Note: You should see the yellow emoji with shade below)</p>

<pre><code>export PS1='\[\e[0;37m\]⌘ \[\e[1;36m\]\W\[\e[1;33m\] &lt;put_emoji_here&gt;  \[\e[0m\]'
</code></pre>

<p>Replace <code>&lt;put_emoji_here&gt;</code> with any emoji you want. Alt+Command+T to open emoji window.
Above line not only adds emoji, but also remove name and hostname, and only show current directory name (not full path). Read <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2006/12/11/how-to-customize-your-terminal-prompt/">here</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Set Current Directory as Terminal&#8217;s Tab Title</h2>

<p>By default, the tab&#8217;s title is &#8216;bash&#8217; and it doesn&#8217;t change. The window title does change. To make tab&#8217;s title changes to current directory automatically, add this line to ~/.bash_profile</p>

<pre><code>PROMPT_COMMAND='update_terminal_cwd; echo -ne "\033]0; ${PWD##*/}\007"'
</code></pre>

<h2>Show Git Branch on Terminal Prompt</h2>

<p>For developers, add this function to ~/.bash_profile</p>

<pre><code>parse_git_branch() {
    git branch --no-color 2&gt; /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/\ &lt;emoji&gt; \ \1/'
}
</code></pre>

<p>then update the PS1</p>

<pre><code>export PS1='\[\e[0;37m\]⌘ \[\e[1;36m\]\W\[\e[1;33m\]$(parse_git_branch) &lt;emoji&gt;  \[\e[0m\]'
</code></pre>

<h2>Show Random Quote on Terminal New Session</h2>

<p>Install fortune</p>

<pre><code>sudo port install fortune
</code></pre>

<p>Add this line to ~/.bash_profile</p>

<pre><code>echo -e "\n\x1B[00;33m$(fortune)\x1B[00m\n"
</code></pre>

<p>Remember to restart the Terminal everytime you make changes. If you want to change some colors, check <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Color_Bash_Prompt#List_of_colors_for_prompt_and_Bash">here</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So <a href="http://ninjablocks.com/">Ninja Blocks</a> came last week. Still thinking of what to do with it though. And also when to play with it. 😜 Weekend was busy with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hackercup">Facebook Hacker Cup</a>. Did you participate? How did you do? I couldn&#8217;t finish the third problem. The program I wrote worked, but took quite some time to complete a test case. （＞д＜）</p>

<p>Got good news today. I passed the Japanese Language Proficiency Test Level 2! ＼（Ｔ∇Ｔ）／  Barely passed it though. Maybe I&#8217;ll take level 2 again this year and will aim for a better score. Did you take one? How was the result?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/053P1m2W2C0G0k0D0K18/idont.jpg" alt="I don't always have birthday" /></p>

<p>Yesterday was that time of the year where another year of my life has gone by. Just like most people, I like to look back and see what I have been doing and what I have accomplished. And it&#8217;s easy to do these days thanks to Facebook and Twitter.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>The Work</h2>

<p>Twelve months seems like a very long time but in reality there are only few things you can achieve in 365 days. I consider myself as a developer so I judge myself based on how many apps I have released, and how well they fare. As such, I didn&#8217;t really accomplish much. During my 27, I released Flutterscape for iPhone, <a href="http://kaomojiapp.com/">Kaomoji for Mac</a>, <a href="https://monoco.jp/signup?ref=n">Monoco for iPhone</a>, and the new <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scribeit/id369606127?mt=8">Scribeit for iPhone</a>.</p>

<p>Kaomoji for Mac fed my ego much better than it did to my stomach. Some people who bought and used it loved it. And they expressed their love vocally. But some factors like the fact that Kaomoji for Mac has a very small market to begin with (Mac users who know what Kaomoji is), the sales was not satisfying. Its biggest achievement was when <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/11/27/kaomojiapp-makes-crazy-text-em.html">BoingBoing</a> caught up with it which resulted in burst of sales. Not much, but at least I could say that my work was featured in famous blog.  (*≧▽≦)ﾉｼ))</p>

<p>Scribeit for iPhone was my first paid app. It&#8217;s been a long time since I gave it my attention, but I finally updated it early this year. It&#8217;s completely rewritten and redesigned from scratch. I&#8217;m kinda proud with it. I hope people love it as much as I do.</p>

<h2>The Travel</h2>

<p class="wide-image">
<img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/2B2R213U2E3S052B3b17/tubingen.jpg" alt="Tubingen">
</p>


<p>Thanks to my wife, during my 27 I finally stepped on the land of Europe. Germany and Switzerland to be exact with a little bit of France. She had work there and I just tagged along. Few things I realized after that trip to Europe:</p>

<ol>
<li>I like living in Japan.</li>
<li>I like beach better than mountain. （⌒▽⌒）</li>
<li>Travelling becomes less fun when you&#8217;re still thinking of your work.</li>
</ol>


<p>It was fun but I wasn&#8217;t fully satisfied since it wasn&#8217;t really a vacation. Wife was working and so did I. I&#8217;d like to go there again one day for <em>real</em> vacation.</p>

<h2>The Social</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m not a social person. I don&#8217;t really like going to an event/meetup without any purpose but networking with people. I found it very random, meaningless, and awkward. I went to a meetup in Tokyo once, but didn&#8217;t really enjoy it. It&#8217;s random because you have to <em>randomly</em> introduce yourself to start conversation. Because without introducing yourself there will be no conversation. And if there&#8217;s no conversation what&#8217;s the point of meeting up. It&#8217;s <em>meaningless</em> because if I want to know about somebody, I can do it better in Twitter. From somebody&#8217;s tweets, I can grasp what kind of person he/she is. And it&#8217;s simpler too since I don&#8217;t need to do the hassle of introducing myself. Finally, it&#8217;s very awkward. Not only it&#8217;s awkward to introduce yourself randomly, but it&#8217;s also very <em>awkward</em> when I find out that I have no interest at all with the person I&#8217;m talking to. Maybe because we have no common interest. Maybe because he/she acts like an ass. True story.</p>

<p>Anyway, I made some new friends online and offline last year. Found somebody who is quite similiar to me in Osaka. He just released an <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/garuda-riders/id572550607?l=en">iPhone game, check it out</a>. I also made friend with a Japanese. Fancy that  (*≧▽≦)ﾉｼ))</p>

<h2>The Resolution</h2>

<p>Nope, no new year resolution. Didn&#8217;t even celebrate new year. I spent new year coding Scribeit. But it will be cool to pass the level 2 of Japanese Proficiency Language Test this year.</p>

<p><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/regular_expressions.png" alt="Regex Man" /></p>

<p>One of the new things I started this year was resuming reading the Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson. Yeah, I haven&#8217;t finished reading it. Shame on me! I&#8217;m also diving in the art of Regular Expression. It just seems cool （＾ω＾）</p>

<p>If you read until here, how about checking out my apps <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scribeit/id369606127?mt=8">Scribeit for iPhone</a> and <a href="http://kaomojiapp.com/">Kaomoji for Mac</a>? ^ ^</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not so many pictures last week. We just went to Namba on weekend. I wasn&#8217;t really planning on buying anything. It was just that it&#8217;s been a long time since I last visited Namba. But unexpectedly, we got some cool stuff! Like the goods from 宇宙兄弟 (Space Brothers) anime! And a Mini Cooper remote control car! I&#8217;m so gonna hack that thing to control it with iPhone. (⌒▽⌒)☆</p>

<p>Oh and I had my birthday yesterday so I made <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scribeit/id369606127?mt=8">Scribeit for iPhone</a> free for a limited time. Grab it now! ;)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you didn&#8217;t know, I just released a new version of my old app, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scribeit/id369606127?mt=8">Scribeit</a>. While I was looking for a way to promote and market it, I figured maybe Apple has some tips and tricks to do this. So I went to iTunes Connect and I noticed there was <a href="https://developer.apple.com/appstore/AppStoreMarketingGuidelines.pdf">App Store Marketing and Advertising Guidelines for Developers</a>. I visit iTunes Connect frequently to check Sales and Trends or Payments and Financial Reports, but never bothered to read it.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>And to my surprise, there are some rules that I never thought they would exist. Some interesting ones are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Never refer to Apple Operating System. Meaning, you must not ever say &#8220;Now Available on iOS&#8221;. Or &#8220;Scribeit for iOS&#8221;. Instead, refer to Apple product names, such as &#8220;Scribeit for iPhone.&#8221; Oops, need to make some change in <a href="http://scribeit.appsccelerated.com/">Scribeit website</a> ^ ^;</li>
<li>Never typeset Apple product names using all uppercase letters. So IPHONE or IPAD is not allowed, people.</li>
<li>Never use a Myriad font for App Store-related text. ⊙０⊙ Why? Anybody care to explain? What&#8217;s with Myriad font?</li>
</ol>


<p>And many more. You should read it. It&#8217;s pretty <em>interesting</em>.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>Thank you for reading this post. Have you checked out my app, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scribeit/id369606127?mt=8">Scribeit</a>. I think you&#8217;ll love it (⌒▽⌒)☆</p>

    <id>http://nicnocquee.com/blog/2013/01/10/thoughts-rdf-its-in-the-juice</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004W2UBYW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=everlasti-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004W2UBYW">Walter Isaacson&#8217;s Steve Jobs</a>, regarding Job&#8217;s superpower Reality Distortion Field:</p>

<blockquote><p>There was little that could shield you from the force, Hertzfeld discovered. “Amazingly, the reality distortion field seemed to be effective even if you were acutely aware of it. We would often discuss potential techniques for grounding it, but after a while most of us gave up, accepting it as a force of nature.” After Jobs decreed that the sodas in the office refrigerator be replaced by Odwalla organic orange and carrot juices, someone on the team had T-shirts made. “Reality Distortion Field,” they said on the front, and on the back, “It’s in the juice!”</p></blockquote>


<p>I want that T-shirt!!</p>

<!-- more -->




<blockquote><p>The result was that the Macintosh team came to share Jobs’s passion for making a great product, not just a profitable one. “Jobs thought of himself as an artist, and he encouraged the design team to think of ourselves that way too,” said Hertzfeld. “The goal was never to beat the competition, or to make a lot of money. It was to do the greatest thing possible, or even a little greater.” He once took the team to see an exhibit of Tiffany glass at the Metropolitan Museum in Manhattan because he believed they could learn from Louis Tiffany’s example of creating great art that could be mass-produced. Recalled Bud Tribble, “We said to ourselves, ‘Hey, if we’re going to make things in our lives, we might as well make them beautiful.’”</p></blockquote>


<p>The end results are indeed amazing. But the process seemed so painful. If I have the chance to lead a team, I&#8217;d rather doing it in a fun way. Life is short anyway, why not having fun?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004W2UBYW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=everlasti-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004W2UBYW">Walter Isaacson&#8217;s Steve Jobs</a>, the Mac was initially called <strong>Annie</strong>:</p>

<blockquote><p>One of Raskin’s dreams was to build an inexpensive computer for the masses, and in 1979 he convinced Mike Markkula to put him in charge of a small development project code-named “Annie” to do just that. Since Raskin thought it was sexist to name computers after women, he redubbed the project in honor of his favorite type of apple, the McIntosh. But he changed the spelling in order not to conflict with the name of the audio equipment maker McIntosh Laboratory. The proposed computer became known as the Macintosh.</p></blockquote>


<p>Today I learned that a guy named Jef Raskin was the <em>biological</em> father of what we know now as Mac.</p>

<!-- more -->




<blockquote><p>In various interviews, Jobs had been referring to computers as a bicycle for the mind; the ability of humans to create a bicycle allowed them to move more efficiently than even a condor, and likewise the ability to create computers would multiply the efficiency of their minds. So one day Jobs decreed that henceforth the Macintosh should be known instead as the Bicycle. This did not go over well. “Burrell and I thought this was the silliest thing we ever heard, and we simply refused to use the new name,” recalled Hertzfeld. Within a month the idea was dropped.</p></blockquote>


<p>Thank God there were people who dared to stand up to Steve for his silly decisions.</p>

<blockquote><p>I never worried about money. I grew up in a middle-class family, so I never thought I would starve. And I learned at Atari that I could be an okay engineer, so I always knew I could get by. I was voluntarily poor when I was in college and India, and I lived a pretty simple life even when I was working. So I went from fairly poor, which was wonderful, because I didn’t have to worry about money, to being incredibly rich, when I also didn’t have to worry about money.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lucky him. Money depresses me everytime. Actually, thinking about money depresses me. It&#8217;s not that I lack money. It&#8217;s enough to enjoy and stay alive. And I&#8217;m very grateful for it. It&#8217;s just not enough to make me not to worry about it. I&#8217;m not worrying about it every seconds. But it just has to come from time to time to slap me in the face to remind me to worry about it. Are you following me? Me neither.</p>

<p>And the other one is One Piece calendar! Too bad there was no 宇宙兄弟 (Space Brothers) calendar. But we found the puzzle of it. （＾▽＾）／＼（＾▽＾）Are you watching the anime too? You should. It&#8217;s like the best anime of 2012. It&#8217;s been a long time since I watched a high quality anime like this. Great story. Very inspiring.</p>
