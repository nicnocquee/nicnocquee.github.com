    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you didn&#8217;t know, I just released a new version of my old app, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scribeit/id369606127?mt=8">Scribeit</a>. While I was looking for a way to promote and market it, I figured maybe Apple has some tips and tricks to do this. So I went to iTunes Connect and I noticed there was <a href="https://developer.apple.com/appstore/AppStoreMarketingGuidelines.pdf">App Store Marketing and Advertising Guidelines for Developers</a>. I visit iTunes Connect frequently to check Sales and Trends or Payments and Financial Reports, but never bothered to read it.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>And to my surprise, there are some rules that I never thought they would exist. Some interesting ones are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Never refer to Apple Operating System. Meaning, you must not ever say &#8220;Now Available on iOS&#8221;. Or &#8220;Scribeit for iOS&#8221;. Instead, refer to Apple product names, such as &#8220;Scribeit for iPhone.&#8221; Oops, need to make some change in <a href="http://scribeit.appsccelerated.com/">Scribeit website</a> ^ ^;</li>
<li>Never typeset Apple product names using all uppercase letters. So IPHONE or IPAD is not allowed, people.</li>
<li>Never use a Myriad font for App Store-related text. ⊙０⊙ Why? Anybody care to explain? What&#8217;s with Myriad font?</li>
</ol>


<p>And many more. You should read it. It&#8217;s pretty <em>interesting</em>.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>Thank you for reading this post. Have you checked out my app, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scribeit/id369606127?mt=8">Scribeit</a>. I think you&#8217;ll love it (⌒▽⌒)☆</p>

    <id>http://nicnocquee.com/blog/2013/01/10/thoughts-rdf-its-in-the-juice</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004W2UBYW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=everlasti-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004W2UBYW">Walter Isaacson&#8217;s Steve Jobs</a>, regarding Job&#8217;s superpower Reality Distortion Field:</p>

<blockquote><p>There was little that could shield you from the force, Hertzfeld discovered. “Amazingly, the reality distortion field seemed to be effective even if you were acutely aware of it. We would often discuss potential techniques for grounding it, but after a while most of us gave up, accepting it as a force of nature.” After Jobs decreed that the sodas in the office refrigerator be replaced by Odwalla organic orange and carrot juices, someone on the team had T-shirts made. “Reality Distortion Field,” they said on the front, and on the back, “It’s in the juice!”</p></blockquote>


<p>I want that T-shirt!!</p>

<!-- more -->




<blockquote><p>The result was that the Macintosh team came to share Jobs’s passion for making a great product, not just a profitable one. “Jobs thought of himself as an artist, and he encouraged the design team to think of ourselves that way too,” said Hertzfeld. “The goal was never to beat the competition, or to make a lot of money. It was to do the greatest thing possible, or even a little greater.” He once took the team to see an exhibit of Tiffany glass at the Metropolitan Museum in Manhattan because he believed they could learn from Louis Tiffany’s example of creating great art that could be mass-produced. Recalled Bud Tribble, “We said to ourselves, ‘Hey, if we’re going to make things in our lives, we might as well make them beautiful.’”</p></blockquote>


<p>The end results are indeed amazing. But the process seemed so painful. If I have the chance to lead a team, I&#8217;d rather doing it in a fun way. Life is short anyway, why not having fun?</p>

    <id>http://nicnocquee.com/blog/2013/01/09/thought-the-world-could-have-gotten-ibicycle</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004W2UBYW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=everlasti-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004W2UBYW">Walter Isaacson&#8217;s Steve Jobs</a>, the Mac was initially called <strong>Annie</strong>:</p>

<blockquote><p>One of Raskin’s dreams was to build an inexpensive computer for the masses, and in 1979 he convinced Mike Markkula to put him in charge of a small development project code-named “Annie” to do just that. Since Raskin thought it was sexist to name computers after women, he redubbed the project in honor of his favorite type of apple, the McIntosh. But he changed the spelling in order not to conflict with the name of the audio equipment maker McIntosh Laboratory. The proposed computer became known as the Macintosh.</p></blockquote>


<p>Today I learned that a guy named Jef Raskin was the <em>biological</em> father of what we know now as Mac.</p>

<!-- more -->




<blockquote><p>In various interviews, Jobs had been referring to computers as a bicycle for the mind; the ability of humans to create a bicycle allowed them to move more efficiently than even a condor, and likewise the ability to create computers would multiply the efficiency of their minds. So one day Jobs decreed that henceforth the Macintosh should be known instead as the Bicycle. This did not go over well. “Burrell and I thought this was the silliest thing we ever heard, and we simply refused to use the new name,” recalled Hertzfeld. Within a month the idea was dropped.</p></blockquote>


<p>Thank God there were people who dared to stand up to Steve for his silly decisions.</p>

<blockquote><p>I never worried about money. I grew up in a middle-class family, so I never thought I would starve. And I learned at Atari that I could be an okay engineer, so I always knew I could get by. I was voluntarily poor when I was in college and India, and I lived a pretty simple life even when I was working. So I went from fairly poor, which was wonderful, because I didn’t have to worry about money, to being incredibly rich, when I also didn’t have to worry about money.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lucky him. Money depresses me everytime. Actually, thinking about money depresses me. It&#8217;s not that I lack money. It&#8217;s enough to enjoy and stay alive. And I&#8217;m very grateful for it. It&#8217;s just not enough to make me not to worry about it. I&#8217;m not worrying about it every seconds. But it just has to come from time to time to slap me in the face to remind me to worry about it. Are you following me? Me neither.</p>

<p>Chapter 8 of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson on the <em>myth of Apple stealing from Xerox</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Xerox’s venture capital division wanted to be part of the second round of Apple financing during the summer of 1979. Jobs made an offer: “I will let you invest a million dollars in Apple if you will open the kimono at PARC.” Xerox accepted. It agreed to show Apple its new technology and in return got to buy 100,000 shares at about $10 each.</p></blockquote>


<p>So much for the stealing. Better call it fair trade.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Continuing,</p>

<blockquote><p>As he once said, “Picasso had a saying—‘good artists copy, great artists steal’—and we have always been shameless about stealing great ideas.”</p></blockquote>


<p>Jobs was a romantic. He liked to exaggerate things. However, he was a good executioner:</p>

<blockquote><p>Jobs and his engineers significantly improved the graphical interface ideas they saw at Xerox PARC, and then were able to implement them in ways that Xerox never could accomplish. For example, the Xerox mouse had three buttons, was complicated, cost $300 apiece, and didn’t roll around smoothly; a few days after his second Xerox PARC visit, Jobs went to a local industrial design firm, IDEO, and told one of its founders, Dean Hovey, that he wanted a simple single-button model that cost $15, “and I want to be able to use it on Formica and my blue jeans.” Hovey complied.</p></blockquote>


<p>and ..</p>

<blockquote><p>Apple’s engineers devised an interface so you could not only drag windows and files around, you could even drop them into folders.</p></blockquote>


<p>He had a good team as well:</p>

<blockquote><p>One of Atkinson’s amazing feats (which we are so accustomed to nowadays that we rarely marvel at it) was to allow the windows on a screen to overlap so that the “top” one clipped into the ones “below” it.</p><p>…</p><p>Atkinson pushed himself to make this trick work because he thought he had seen this capability during his visit to Xerox PARC. In fact the folks at PARC had never accomplished it, and they later told him they were amazed that he had done so.</p></blockquote>


<p>So Jobs and team not only got a piece of technology for a price, but they also improved the hell out of it. Impressive.</p>

    <id>http://nicnocquee.com/blog/2013/01/05/thoughts-january-4-was-my-real-new-year</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I write this sentence on my MBA which rests on my lap, the digital clock at the top right corner shows &#8220;Fri Jan 4 11:26:50 PM&#8221;. In around 30 minutes, it will be January 5. It&#8217;s been 4 days since the year 2013 closed the door of 2012 and came to our life. The holiday for most people in Japan has ended yesterday. Yet here I am feeling like finally I can say &#8220;Happy new year!&#8221; sincerelly.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Danny Choo asked good questions on his post <a href="http://www.dannychoo.com/post/en/26806/2013+New+Years+Greetings.html">2013 New Years Greetings!</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Happy new year folks! Hows your new year celebrations? <br/>But before you answer that, have you ever thought to yourself why we celebrate the new year? Is it because we want to celebrate what we have achieved in the previous year? Is it because we are celebrating what we want to do in the up n coming year? Is it because we are celebrating the fact that most of us get time off work/school?</p></blockquote>


<p>In my opinion, new year is a good time to start things new. Either starting something really new, or simply restarting what we have been doing. But remember what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_Revolutions">Oracle</a> said,</p>

<blockquote><p>everything that has a beginning has an end</p></blockquote>


<p>There are ways to read that between the line, but I&#8217;d like to think that to really begin, we need to end something. I had not finished what I wanted to finish in 2012. Thus, I did not fully celebrate new year.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0G3e350L3m1a2K1N0U1M/Screen%20Shot%202013-01-04%20at%2011.42.19%20PM.png" alt="Last day of 2011 with friends in Ise" /></p>

<p>This year, we, as in me and wifey, <em>celebrated</em> new year differently compared to previous years. Last year, we spent new year in Ise together with our friends. However, this year it was just the two of us in our apartment. We were just there sitting on the yellow sofa I got nearly three years ago, if my memory serves me right, from an Indian guy whom I didn&#8217;t (still don&#8217;t) know. We were watching Japanese TV Show called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dhaku_Uta_Gassen">Kohaku (紅白) Uta Gassen</a> where a bunch of Japanese singers and musicians was divided into two teams, red and white teams, and they competed with each other.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/222Q0y0W1Y2h3I3s460T/maki-chan1.png" alt="Maki-chan on Kohaku" /></p>

<p>But we weren&#8217;t really watching the show. We were most of the time looking at our Macbook&#8217;s monitors. I was busy with XCode while wifey was busy with Photoshop. We were working on Scribeit. Scribeit is the second app I put in Apple Store. It is my first paid app. And it is the only paid app at this moment. It&#8217;s been two years since I updated it. It was never even updated to support retina display when iPhone 4 was released. Despite of that, number of downloads every month never reaches zero. So I finally made up my mind to update this baby and to finish it before 2012 came to an end. And my wife helped me with the graphics and stuff.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/2B081D0J0h1c0c450312/9gag2013.png" alt="2013 is the first year since 1987 to have four different numbers" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately, everything doesn&#8217;t always work as planned. As this part of the world turned from December 31 to January 1, Scribeit was not completely done yet. An unexpected behaviour in the app prevented me from fully enjoying the moment where people celebrated the first year since 1987 to have four different numbers!</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3h0o2n1X3a3T0j0R1y0s/Screen%20Shot%202013-01-05%20at%2012.17.08%20AM.png" alt="New Scribeit 2013" /></p>

<p>At around 3AM of January 1, I finally found the problem. I closed my Mac and decided to wrap things up in the morning. Then came January 2. Followed by January 3. You see, I realized that contrary to popular belief, <em>finishing</em> is way more difficult than starting. You can always start <em>small</em>, but you cannot finish small. You can start from small things one by one. But you cannot finish only a part of the whole. Of course there&#8217;s no such thing as completely <strong>finish</strong>. There&#8217;s always something to add. Or to reduce. I&#8217;m talking about finishing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a>. You cannot ship a half ass product. You need to reach that state of MVP. And here&#8217;s a fact: even an MVP has many check lists to complete. If you think starting is hard, finishing will be hell for you.</p>

<p>So, on the last day of new year holiday, I was finally able to submit our baby to App Store. We think it looks amazing. We love it. And we think you&#8217;ll love it too. ♡＾▽＾♡ Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/nicnocquee">Twitter</a> to know when the update is available on the App Store.</p>

<p>☆☆ Happy new year!</p>

<p>☆☆ 明けましておめでとうございます！</p>

<p>☆☆ Selamat tahun baru!</p>

<p>☆☆ <strong>UPDATE!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Scribeit is up in the <a href="http://scribeit.appsccelerated.com/">App Store</a> now! Check it out!

<p>It&#8217;s 2013! Happy new year, people! Nothing much last week. Was busy trying to finish the update for my app, Scribeit. Spent new year in front of XCode while watching the annual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dhaku_Uta_Gassen">Kohaku</a> (紅白) TV show.</p>

<p>Kohaku is a TV show aired on new year&#8217;s eve where two teams of musicians and artists competing with each other. There were some I knew like Arashi, SMAP, Yui, AKB48, Tokio, etc, but most of them, I had no idea. And I think I missed Funky Monkey Babys. Too bad.  (¬､¬) How did you spend your new year&#8217;s eve?</p>

<p>The picture above (via <a href="https://twitter.com/waxpancake/status/283736105717755904">@waxpancake</a>) speaks two things at least. First, Apple must be selling tons of iPads. Second, iOS users are active and proud of using Apple device. As an iOS developer, these two things are good news.</p>

<p>And this report from <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/12/24/apple-microsoft-sony-store-traffic/">CNNMoney</a> is not a good sign for Microsoft and Sony. People don&#8217;t wait for Santa to come at their homes anymore. They just go to Apple Store apparently.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Merry christmas, everyone! Seems like there&#8217;s no white christmas here in Kobe. And since Japan does not officially celebrate Christmas, everyone is working now. At least we got a holiday yesterday thanks to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihito">Emperor&#8217;s birthday</a>. The emperor&#8217;s birthday was actually on the 23rd, but since December 23 was Sunday, they moved the holiday to Monday.</p>

<p>So we took this chance to visit an illumination event in Tennoji, Tennoji Illuminage. Not as impressive as other illumination events we have visited before though. Not to mention it&#8217;s not free. Got to pay 1000 yen to enter the park.</p>

<p>On weekend, we watched the long waited Les Misérables. Pretty interesting movie for me. It felt like watching a 2.5-hour trailer. Because every scene was so dramatic thanks to the nonstop music. I like Anne Hatheway&#8217;s acting. My only problem was Russell Crowe&#8217;s singing. It just felt not quite right. Anyway, I wasn&#8217;t really a fan of musical movie, but Les Misérables was not bad.</p>

<p>After the movie, we went to German Christmas Market. Nothing was really special except the cute Santa mug which we got for buying a cup of cocoa.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two more weeks then boom. 2012 will end. Time flies. There wasn&#8217;t much happening last week. We just went to watch The Hobbit. I wasn&#8217;t really a fan of Lord of The Rings. I found it really boring. So I wasn&#8217;t really expecting anything from The Hobbit. But turned out The Hobbit was good. Better than LOTR. It was funny, lots of actions, and adventurous. Or maybe it&#8217;s just because there were no Men in the Hobbits. Men are so boring. Have you watched it? What do you think?</p>

<p>Yesterday we went to the last day of annual illumination in Kobe, The Luminarie. There&#8217;s nothing in this event but lights. Beautiful lights. This is one of the things I like from Japan. There are lots of festivals/events/祭り. There&#8217;s something to look forward to in every seasons.</p>

There weren&#8217;t much happening actually. Just <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/monoco/id539376693?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Monoco</a> app (Japan only) update got approved by Apple and it climbed back to the top 4 of free apps in Catalog category. It was at the second place the first time it was released, then suddenly disappeared from the top 200 of Catalog, then appeared again at 22nd. What a ride.</p>

<p>Speaking of app I made, I also updated <a href="http://kaomojiapp.com/">Kaomoji for Mac</a> with Favorites and Recent lists. Added some new categories as well like Christmas and New Year kaomoji. Check it out if you own a Mac. （＾＿－）≡★</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I got a pleasant surprise. One of my app, <a href="http://kaomojiapp.com">Kaomoji for Mac</a>, got picked up by a  famous (I know it, then it must be famous) blog, <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/11/27/kaomojiapp-makes-crazy-text-em.html">BoingBoing</a>. I wonder how the author discovered Kaomoji app. Nevertheless, I am so glad there are strangers out there who found my app useful and love it.</p>

<p>On weekend, I faced my demon, The Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT). Fell asleep a little bit during the exam thanks to spending great time with friends until 4 AM in the morning of the exam ( ⌒o⌒)人(⌒-⌒ )v Definitely gonna fail again this time. But it didn&#8217;t bother me at all. Since I wasn&#8217;t expecting to pass the exam. I just wanted to know how the test was. Next time I&#8217;ll be more prepared. Did you take the exam? What level? How do you think you were doing?</p>

<p>After the exam, we went to an illumination park in Kobe Fruits and Flowers Park. It was beautiful. Not as big as the illumination in <a href="http://tourismmiejapan.com/search/spot.php?act=dtl&amp;id=22/">Nabano Sato</a> we visited last year, but it was beautiful still.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google posted on Facebook a post that asks people to sign a petition to free the internet. They did not only post it in English, but in Japanese and <em>surprisingly</em> in Indonesian as well.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/202o0I2c1J1F2s231p1f/Screen%20Shot%202012-12-04%20at%2012.27.59%20AM-2.png" alt="Reactions to English CTA" /></p>

<p>I see some spams and useless comments in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151284026962838&amp;set=a.404124792837.181416.104958162837&amp;type=1">English post</a>, but there are some serious comments.</p>

<p>As expected of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151284042017838&amp;set=a.404124792837.181416.104958162837&amp;type=1">Japanese</a>, only few comments, but pretty serious. No spam. Although not sure if the first comment is a spam.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0M0r0k0f3n151F1v1j3T/Screen%20Shot%202012-12-04%20at%2012.27.31%20AM-2.png" alt="Reactions to Indonesian CTA" /></p>

<p>I won&#8217;t translate the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151284041247838&amp;set=a.404124792837.181416.104958162837&amp;type=1">Indonesian</a>, but let&#8217;s just say I wish these people never get to use internet. At first I thought this different reactions implies level of education for each regions. But my wife made a good point that it might not be the case. Because there are some very smart and educated Indonesians. So I guess this just shows how Indonesians use Facebook.</p>

<p>But this is not the first time I see useless comments written in my language. I saw many spams in Facebook posts, Twitter tweets, or Google+ posts written by Indonesian. It&#8217;s actually a good thing since it means internet is starting to reach more people in Indonesia. Unfortunately, the majority of people in my country still has no clue how to use the internet. Spamming is the easiest thing (or the only thing?) they can come up with.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Woah, it&#8217;s already end of November. One more month and comes 2013. Time flies indeed. Last week has been a very busy week. Didn&#8217;t go out much during weekday. Only went to Junkudo Umeda, the biggest book store in Japan. And boy it was big. Seven floors of books heaven. And if you like reading English novels, books, you&#8217;re gonna like the 6th floor.</p>

<p>From Junkudo, we walked around parts of Umeda that we had never been to. I thought I knew Umeda like the back of my hand. But there&#8217;s more than meet the ferries wheel. :p</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://cocoaheads.tumblr.com/post/35711948405/xcode-in-a-nutshell"><img src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdhn7nq1pE1qbs1hto1_1280.png" alt="XCode in a nutshell" /></a></p>

<p>In XCode 4, to have the split screen feature, you have to use the Assistant Editor. It&#8217;s that &#8220;&#8221;Black Tie&#8221; Mode.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0R0j3V441K2q3H2r0E2c/xcode-split-0.png" alt="Tap the Assistant Editor to split the screen" /></p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t fancy having the editors horizontally, you can easily stack them vertically by clicking View -> Assistant Editor -> All editors stacked vertically.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0y2k3E213J3Z2T2E2Y0n/xcode-split-4.png" alt="Editors. Stack them all." /></p>

<p>Normally, the assistant editor will automatically show the counterpart of the file opened in the main editor. But if you want to defy the intelligence of the xcode, you can click on the Black Tie icon Counterparts then choose Manual.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/310T0L2n2M3d1h151n2i/xcode-split-5.png" alt="Manually select file to open in assistant editor" /></p>

<p>If you have tons of source codes, it might be difficult to search the file you want to open. Here&#8217;s the trick. Click on the file name on Assistant Editor bar, then just type the name of the file you&#8217;re looking for. XCode auto-completion will do the work for you.</p>

<p>And last, if you&#8217;re not satisfied with monogamy, you can conduct polygamy up to 5 assistants. You might be able to have more assistants in a bigger screen. But in my Macbook Air, 5 is the limit. Makes sense, cause it&#8217;s getting too crowded.</p>
