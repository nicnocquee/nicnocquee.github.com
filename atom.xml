    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I found out about <a href="http://icomoon.io/">icomoon</a> and was wondering how to use the icon fonts on Mac. Turns out it&#8217;s not so difficult.</p>

<p>Skipt this steps if you already have icon fonts.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://icomoon.io/app/">icomoon app</a>, select some fonts. (Tip: You can drag and select multiple fonts quickly.)</li>
<li>Generate the font then download.</li>
<li>Install the downloaded icomoon.ttf font by double clicking it.</li>
</ol>


<!-- more -->


<p>Now the fun part.</p>

<ol>
<li>Open System Preferences.</li>
<li>Select Language &amp; Text.</li>
<li>Check Unicode Hex Input in Input Source.</li>
</ol>


<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3I3s2v121n3d1i2r311Z/Screen%20Shot%202013-10-16%20at%207.08.13%20PM.png" alt="Unicode Hex Input in System Preferences OS X" /></p>

<p>That&#8217;s it! Well not quite. The secret to use the font is <strong>by choosing Unicode Hex Input from Input menu in menu bar, then type the unicode code while pressing Option (⌥) key</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0a1x2q2I3K3L1J05472Z/Screen%20Shot%202013-10-16%20at%206.45.42%20PM.png" alt="Change Input from Menu bar" /></p>

<p>So for example, to insert ♥, while pressing Option, type 2665. (Option+2665). The same goes for icon fonts generated by icomoon. Insert the unicde character then change the font to icomoon font.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0D2c3Z1W2d0M163D3g3k/Screen%20Shot%202013-10-16%20at%206.50.25%20PM.png" alt="Insert unicode and use custom icon font in Pixelmator" /></p>

<p>Now have fun with custom icon fonts!</p>

<p>One of my hobby is to star or clone open source iOS components/libraries in Github. There are just many good open source projects there that can speed up app development. And I&#8217;m pretty sure many apps in the app store are using these open source libraries. Unfortunately, most apps don&#8217;t act like good open source citizens by not showing the attributions.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Some big name apps show the attributions in the app. Facebook for example. You can find it in Settings -> Facebook -> Settings -> About. There are many libraries they listed there. But some libraries seem to be server-side libraries. The iOS-related open source libraries (as for version 183159) are</p>

    <link href="http://nicnocquee.com/blog/2013/04/06/osx-fun-with-terminal/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-06T00:08:00+09:00</updated>
    <id>http://nicnocquee.com/blog/2013/04/06/osx-fun-with-terminal</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/1c3C0z0t1g0e2K1y2X0M/Screen%20Shot%202013-04-06%20at%2012.00.21%20AM.png" alt="Customize OSX Terminal" /></p>

<p>Some fun things you can do to pimp your OSX Terminal: (I&#8217;m using Mountain Lion fyi)</p>

<h2>Customize Terminal Prompt with Emoji</h2>

<p>Add this line to ~/.bash_profile (Note: You should see the yellow emoji with shade below)</p>

<pre><code>export PS1='\[\e[0;37m\]⌘ \[\e[1;36m\]\W\[\e[1;33m\] &lt;put_emoji_here&gt;  \[\e[0m\]'
</code></pre>

<p>Replace <code>&lt;put_emoji_here&gt;</code> with any emoji you want. Alt+Command+T to open emoji window.
Above line not only adds emoji, but also remove name and hostname, and only show current directory name (not full path). Read <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2006/12/11/how-to-customize-your-terminal-prompt/">here</a> for more information.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Set Current Directory as Terminal&#8217;s Tab Title</h2>

<p>By default, the tab&#8217;s title is &#8216;bash&#8217; and it doesn&#8217;t change. The window title does change. To make tab&#8217;s title changes to current directory automatically, add this line to ~/.bash_profile</p>

<pre><code>PROMPT_COMMAND='update_terminal_cwd; echo -ne "\033]0; ${PWD##*/}\007"'
</code></pre>

<h2>Show Git Branch on Terminal Prompt</h2>

<p>For developers, add this function to ~/.bash_profile</p>

<pre><code>parse_git_branch() {
    git branch --no-color 2&gt; /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/\ &lt;emoji&gt; \ \1/'
}
</code></pre>

<p>then update the PS1</p>

<pre><code>export PS1='\[\e[0;37m\]⌘ \[\e[1;36m\]\W\[\e[1;33m\]$(parse_git_branch) &lt;emoji&gt;  \[\e[0m\]'
</code></pre>

<h2>Show Random Quote on Terminal New Session</h2>

<p>Install fortune</p>

<pre><code>sudo port install fortune
</code></pre>

<p>Add this line to ~/.bash_profile</p>

<pre><code>echo -e "\n\x1B[00;33m$(fortune)\x1B[00m\n"
</code></pre>

<p>Remember to restart the Terminal everytime you make changes. If you want to change some colors, check <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Color_Bash_Prompt#List_of_colors_for_prompt_and_Bash">here</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So <a href="http://ninjablocks.com/">Ninja Blocks</a> came last week. Still thinking of what to do with it though. And also when to play with it. 😜 Weekend was busy with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hackercup">Facebook Hacker Cup</a>. Did you participate? How did you do? I couldn&#8217;t finish the third problem. The program I wrote worked, but took quite some time to complete a test case. （＞д＜）</p>

<p>Got good news today. I passed the Japanese Language Proficiency Test Level 2! ＼（Ｔ∇Ｔ）／  Barely passed it though. Maybe I&#8217;ll take level 2 again this year and will aim for a better score. Did you take one? How was the result?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/053P1m2W2C0G0k0D0K18/idont.jpg" alt="I don't always have birthday" /></p>

<p>Yesterday was that time of the year where another year of my life has gone by. Just like most people, I like to look back and see what I have been doing and what I have accomplished. And it&#8217;s easy to do these days thanks to Facebook and Twitter.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>The Work</h2>

<p>Twelve months seems like a very long time but in reality there are only few things you can achieve in 365 days. I consider myself as a developer so I judge myself based on how many apps I have released, and how well they fare. As such, I didn&#8217;t really accomplish much. During my 27, I released Flutterscape for iPhone, <a href="http://kaomojiapp.com/">Kaomoji for Mac</a>, <a href="https://monoco.jp/signup?ref=n">Monoco for iPhone</a>, and the new <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scribeit/id369606127?mt=8">Scribeit for iPhone</a>.</p>

<p>Kaomoji for Mac fed my ego much better than it did to my stomach. Some people who bought and used it loved it. And they expressed their love vocally. But some factors like the fact that Kaomoji for Mac has a very small market to begin with (Mac users who know what Kaomoji is), the sales was not satisfying. Its biggest achievement was when <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/11/27/kaomojiapp-makes-crazy-text-em.html">BoingBoing</a> caught up with it which resulted in burst of sales. Not much, but at least I could say that my work was featured in famous blog.  (*≧▽≦)ﾉｼ))</p>

<p>Scribeit for iPhone was my first paid app. It&#8217;s been a long time since I gave it my attention, but I finally updated it early this year. It&#8217;s completely rewritten and redesigned from scratch. I&#8217;m kinda proud with it. I hope people love it as much as I do.</p>

<h2>The Travel</h2>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/2B2R213U2E3S052B3b17/tubingen.jpg" alt="Tubingen" /></p>

<p>Thanks to my wife, during my 27 I finally stepped on the land of Europe. Germany and Switzerland to be exact with a little bit of France. She had work there and I just tagged along. Few things I realized after that trip to Europe:</p>

<ol>
<li>I like living in Japan.</li>
<li>I like beach better than mountain. （⌒▽⌒）</li>
<li>Travelling becomes less fun when you&#8217;re still thinking of your work.</li>
</ol>


<p>It was fun but I wasn&#8217;t fully satisfied since it wasn&#8217;t really a vacation. Wife was working and so did I. I&#8217;d like to go there again one day for <em>real</em> vacation.</p>

<h2>The Social</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m not a social person. I don&#8217;t really like going to an event/meetup without any purpose but networking with people. I found it very random, meaningless, and awkward. I went to a meetup in Tokyo once, but didn&#8217;t really enjoy it. It&#8217;s random because you have to <em>randomly</em> introduce yourself to start conversation. Because without introducing yourself there will be no conversation. And if there&#8217;s no conversation what&#8217;s the point of meeting up. It&#8217;s <em>meaningless</em> because if I want to know about somebody, I can do it better in Twitter. From somebody&#8217;s tweets, I can grasp what kind of person he/she is. And it&#8217;s simpler too since I don&#8217;t need to do the hassle of introducing myself. Finally, it&#8217;s very awkward. Not only it&#8217;s awkward to introduce yourself randomly, but it&#8217;s also very <em>awkward</em> when I find out that I have no interest at all with the person I&#8217;m talking to. Maybe because we have no common interest. Maybe because he/she acts like an ass. True story.</p>

<p>Anyway, I made some new friends online and offline last year. Found somebody who is quite similiar to me in Osaka. He just released an <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/garuda-riders/id572550607?l=en">iPhone game, check it out</a>. I also made friend with a Japanese. Fancy that  (*≧▽≦)ﾉｼ))</p>

<h2>The Resolution</h2>

<p>Nope, no new year resolution. Didn&#8217;t even celebrate new year. I spent new year coding Scribeit. But it will be cool to pass the level 2 of Japanese Proficiency Language Test this year.</p>

<p><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/regular_expressions.png" alt="Regex Man" /></p>

<p>One of the new things I started this year was resuming reading the Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson. Yeah, I haven&#8217;t finished reading it. Shame on me! I&#8217;m also diving in the art of Regular Expression. It just seems cool （＾ω＾）</p>

<p>If you read until here, how about checking out my apps <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scribeit/id369606127?mt=8">Scribeit for iPhone</a> and <a href="http://kaomojiapp.com/">Kaomoji for Mac</a>? ^ ^</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you didn&#8217;t know, I just released a new version of my old app, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scribeit/id369606127?mt=8">Scribeit</a>. While I was looking for a way to promote and market it, I figured maybe Apple has some tips and tricks to do this. So I went to iTunes Connect and I noticed there was <a href="https://developer.apple.com/appstore/AppStoreMarketingGuidelines.pdf">App Store Marketing and Advertising Guidelines for Developers</a>. I visit iTunes Connect frequently to check Sales and Trends or Payments and Financial Reports, but never bothered to read it.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>And to my surprise, there are some rules that I never thought they would exist. Some interesting ones are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Never refer to Apple Operating System. Meaning, you must not ever say &#8220;Now Available on iOS&#8221;. Or &#8220;Scribeit for iOS&#8221;. Instead, refer to Apple product names, such as &#8220;Scribeit for iPhone.&#8221; Oops, need to make some change in <a href="http://scribeit.appsccelerated.com/">Scribeit website</a> ^ ^;</li>
<li>Never typeset Apple product names using all uppercase letters. So IPHONE or IPAD is not allowed, people.</li>
<li>Never use a Myriad font for App Store-related text. ⊙０⊙ Why? Anybody care to explain? What&#8217;s with Myriad font?</li>
</ol>


<p>And many more. You should read it. It&#8217;s pretty <em>interesting</em>.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>Thank you for reading this post. Have you checked out my app, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scribeit/id369606127?mt=8">Scribeit</a>. I think you&#8217;ll love it (⌒▽⌒)☆</p>

    <id>http://nicnocquee.com/blog/2013/01/10/thoughts-rdf-its-in-the-juice</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004W2UBYW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=everlasti-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004W2UBYW">Walter Isaacson&#8217;s Steve Jobs</a>, regarding Job&#8217;s superpower Reality Distortion Field:</p>

<blockquote><p>There was little that could shield you from the force, Hertzfeld discovered. “Amazingly, the reality distortion field seemed to be effective even if you were acutely aware of it. We would often discuss potential techniques for grounding it, but after a while most of us gave up, accepting it as a force of nature.” After Jobs decreed that the sodas in the office refrigerator be replaced by Odwalla organic orange and carrot juices, someone on the team had T-shirts made. “Reality Distortion Field,” they said on the front, and on the back, “It’s in the juice!”</p></blockquote>


<p>I want that T-shirt!!</p>

<!-- more -->




<blockquote><p>The result was that the Macintosh team came to share Jobs’s passion for making a great product, not just a profitable one. “Jobs thought of himself as an artist, and he encouraged the design team to think of ourselves that way too,” said Hertzfeld. “The goal was never to beat the competition, or to make a lot of money. It was to do the greatest thing possible, or even a little greater.” He once took the team to see an exhibit of Tiffany glass at the Metropolitan Museum in Manhattan because he believed they could learn from Louis Tiffany’s example of creating great art that could be mass-produced. Recalled Bud Tribble, “We said to ourselves, ‘Hey, if we’re going to make things in our lives, we might as well make them beautiful.’”</p></blockquote>


<p>The end results are indeed amazing. But the process seemed so painful. If I have the chance to lead a team, I&#8217;d rather doing it in a fun way. Life is short anyway, why not having fun?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004W2UBYW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=everlasti-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004W2UBYW">Walter Isaacson&#8217;s Steve Jobs</a>, the Mac was initially called <strong>Annie</strong>:</p>

<blockquote><p>One of Raskin’s dreams was to build an inexpensive computer for the masses, and in 1979 he convinced Mike Markkula to put him in charge of a small development project code-named “Annie” to do just that. Since Raskin thought it was sexist to name computers after women, he redubbed the project in honor of his favorite type of apple, the McIntosh. But he changed the spelling in order not to conflict with the name of the audio equipment maker McIntosh Laboratory. The proposed computer became known as the Macintosh.</p></blockquote>


<p>Today I learned that a guy named Jef Raskin was the <em>biological</em> father of what we know now as Mac.</p>

<!-- more -->




<blockquote><p>In various interviews, Jobs had been referring to computers as a bicycle for the mind; the ability of humans to create a bicycle allowed them to move more efficiently than even a condor, and likewise the ability to create computers would multiply the efficiency of their minds. So one day Jobs decreed that henceforth the Macintosh should be known instead as the Bicycle. This did not go over well. “Burrell and I thought this was the silliest thing we ever heard, and we simply refused to use the new name,” recalled Hertzfeld. Within a month the idea was dropped.</p></blockquote>


<p>Thank God there were people who dared to stand up to Steve for his silly decisions.</p>

<blockquote><p>I never worried about money. I grew up in a middle-class family, so I never thought I would starve. And I learned at Atari that I could be an okay engineer, so I always knew I could get by. I was voluntarily poor when I was in college and India, and I lived a pretty simple life even when I was working. So I went from fairly poor, which was wonderful, because I didn’t have to worry about money, to being incredibly rich, when I also didn’t have to worry about money.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lucky him. Money depresses me everytime. Actually, thinking about money depresses me. It&#8217;s not that I lack money. It&#8217;s enough to enjoy and stay alive. And I&#8217;m very grateful for it. It&#8217;s just not enough to make me not to worry about it. I&#8217;m not worrying about it every seconds. But it just has to come from time to time to slap me in the face to remind me to worry about it. Are you following me? Me neither.</p>

<p>And the other one is One Piece calendar! Too bad there was no 宇宙兄弟 (Space Brothers) calendar. But we found the puzzle of it. （＾▽＾）／＼（＾▽＾）Are you watching the anime too? You should.

<p>Chapter 8 of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson on the <em>myth of Apple stealing from Xerox</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Xerox’s venture capital division wanted to be part of the second round of Apple financing during the summer of 1979. Jobs made an offer: “I will let you invest a million dollars in Apple if you will open the kimono at PARC.” Xerox accepted. It agreed to show Apple its new technology and in return got to buy 100,000 shares at about $10 each.</p></blockquote>


<p>So much for the stealing. Better call it fair trade.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Continuing,</p>

<blockquote><p>As he once said, “Picasso had a saying—‘good artists copy, great artists steal’—and we have always been shameless about stealing great ideas.”</p></blockquote>


<p>Jobs was a romantic. He liked to exaggerate things. However, he was a good executioner:</p>

<blockquote><p>Jobs and his engineers significantly improved the graphical interface ideas they saw at Xerox PARC, and then were able to implement them in ways that Xerox never could accomplish. For example, the Xerox mouse had three buttons, was complicated, cost $300 apiece, and didn’t roll around smoothly; a few days after his second Xerox PARC visit, Jobs went to a local industrial design firm, IDEO, and told one of its founders, Dean Hovey, that he wanted a simple single-button model that cost $15, “and I want to be able to use it on Formica and my blue jeans.” Hovey complied.</p></blockquote>


<p>and ..</p>

<blockquote><p>Apple’s engineers devised an interface so you could not only drag windows and files around, you could even drop them into folders.</p></blockquote>


<p>He had a good team as well:</p>

<blockquote><p>One of Atkinson’s amazing feats (which we are so accustomed to nowadays that we rarely marvel at it) was to allow the windows on a screen to overlap so that the “top” one clipped into the ones “below” it.</p><p>…</p><p>Atkinson pushed himself to make this trick work because he thought he had seen this capability during his visit to Xerox PARC. In fact the folks at PARC had never accomplished it, and they later told him they were amazed that he had done so.</p></blockquote>


<p>So Jobs and team not only got a piece of technology for a price, but they also improved the hell out of it. Impressive.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I write this sentence on my MBA which rests on my lap, the digital clock at the top right corner shows &#8220;Fri Jan 4 11:26:50 PM&#8221;. In around 30 minutes, it will be January 5. It&#8217;s been 4 days since the year 2013 closed the door of 2012 and came to our life. The holiday for most people in Japan has ended yesterday. Yet here I am feeling like finally I can say &#8220;Happy new year!&#8221; sincerelly.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Danny Choo asked good questions on his post <a href="http://www.dannychoo.com/post/en/26806/2013+New+Years+Greetings.html">2013 New Years Greetings!</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Happy new year folks! Hows your new year celebrations? <br/>But before you answer that, have you ever thought to yourself why we celebrate the new year? Is it because we want to celebrate what we have achieved in the previous year? Is it because we are celebrating what we want to do in the up n coming year? Is it because we are celebrating the fact that most of us get time off work/school?</p></blockquote>


<p>In my opinion, new year is a good time to start things new. Either starting something really new, or simply restarting what we have been doing. But remember what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_Revolutions">Oracle</a> said,</p>

<blockquote><p>everything that has a beginning has an end</p></blockquote>


<p>There are ways to read that between the line, but I&#8217;d like to think that to really begin, we need to end something. I had not finished what I wanted to finish in 2012. Thus, I did not fully celebrate new year.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0G3e350L3m1a2K1N0U1M/Screen%20Shot%202013-01-04%20at%2011.42.19%20PM.png" alt="Last day of 2011 with friends in Ise" /></p>

<p>This year, we, as in me and wifey, <em>celebrated</em> new year differently compared to previous years. Last year, we spent new year in Ise together with our friends. However, this year it was just the two of us in our apartment. We were just there sitting on the yellow sofa I got nearly three years ago, if my memory serves me right, from an Indian guy whom I didn&#8217;t (still don&#8217;t) know. We were watching Japanese TV Show called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dhaku_Uta_Gassen">Kohaku (紅白) Uta Gassen</a> where a bunch of Japanese singers and musicians was divided into two teams, red and white teams, and they competed with each other.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/222Q0y0W1Y2h3I3s460T/maki-chan1.png" alt="Maki-chan on Kohaku" /></p>

<p>But we weren&#8217;t really watching the show. We were most of the time looking at our Macbook&#8217;s monitors. I was busy with XCode while wifey was busy with Photoshop. We were working on Scribeit. Scribeit is the second app I put in Apple Store. It is my first paid app. And it is the only paid app at this moment. It&#8217;s been two years since I updated it. It was never even updated to support retina display when iPhone 4 was released. Despite of that, number of downloads every month never reaches zero. So I finally made up my mind to update this baby and to finish it before 2012 came to an end. And my wife helped me with the graphics and stuff.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/2B081D0J0h1c0c450312/9gag2013.png" alt="2013 is the first year since 1987 to have four different numbers" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately, everything doesn&#8217;t always work as planned. As this part of the world turned from December 31 to January 1, Scribeit was not completely done yet. An unexpected behaviour in the app prevented me from fully enjoying the moment where people celebrated the first year since 1987 to have four different numbers!</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3h0o2n1X3a3T0j0R1y0s/Screen%20Shot%202013-01-05%20at%2012.17.08%20AM.png" alt="New Scribeit 2013" /></p>

<p>At around 3AM of January 1, I finally found the problem. I closed my Mac and decided to wrap things up in the morning. Then came January 2. Followed by January 3. You see, I realized that contrary to popular belief, <em>finishing</em> is way more difficult than starting. You can always start <em>small</em>, but you cannot finish small. You can start from small things one by one. But you cannot finish only a part of the whole. Of course there&#8217;s no such thing as completely <strong>finish</strong>. There&#8217;s always something to add. Or to reduce. I&#8217;m talking about finishing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a>. You cannot ship a half ass product. You need to reach that state of MVP. And here&#8217;s a fact: even an MVP has many check lists to complete. If you think starting is hard, finishing will be hell for you.</p>

<p>So, on the last day of new year holiday, I was finally able to submit our baby to App Store. We think it looks amazing. We love it. And we think you&#8217;ll love it too. ♡＾▽＾♡ Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/nicnocquee">Twitter</a> to know when the update is available on the App Store.</p>

<p>☆☆ Happy new year!</p>

<p>☆☆ 明けましておめでとうございます！</p>

<p>☆☆ Selamat tahun baru!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s 2013! Happy new year, people! Nothing much last week. Was busy trying to finish the update for my app, Scribeit. Spent new year in front of XCode while watching the annual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dhaku_Uta_Gassen">Kohaku</a> (紅白) TV show.</p>

<p>Kohaku is a TV show aired on new year&#8217;s eve where two teams of musicians and artists competing with each other. There were some I knew like Arashi, SMAP, Yui, AKB48, Tokio, etc, but most of them, I had no idea. And I think I missed Funky Monkey Babys. Too bad.  (¬､¬) How did you spend your new year&#8217;s eve?</p>

<p>The picture above (via <a href="https://twitter.com/waxpancake/status/283736105717755904">@waxpancake</a>) speaks two things at least. First, Apple must be selling tons of iPads.

<p>And this report from <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/12/24/apple-microsoft-sony-store-traffic/">CNNMoney</a> is not a good sign for Microsoft and Sony. People don&#8217;t wait for Santa to come at their homes anymore. They just go to Apple Store apparently.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Merry christmas, everyone! Seems like there&#8217;s no white christmas here in Kobe. And since Japan does not officially celebrate Christmas, everyone is working now. At least we got a holiday yesterday thanks to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihito">Emperor&#8217;s birthday</a>. The emperor&#8217;s birthday was actually on the 23rd, but since December 23 was Sunday, they moved the holiday to Monday.</p>

<p>So we took this chance to visit an illumination event in Tennoji, Tennoji Illuminage. Not as impressive as other illumination events we have visited before though. Not to mention it&#8217;s not free. Got to pay 1000 yen to enter the park.</p>

<p>On weekend, we watched the long waited Les Misérables. Pretty interesting movie for me. It felt like watching a 2.5-hour trailer. Because every scene was so dramatic thanks to the nonstop music. I like Anne Hatheway&#8217;s acting. My only problem was Russell Crowe&#8217;s singing. It just felt not quite right. Anyway, I wasn&#8217;t really a fan of musical movie, but Les Misérables was not bad.</p>

<p>After the movie, we went to German Christmas Market. Nothing was really special except the cute Santa mug which we got for buying a cup of cocoa.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two more weeks then boom. 2012 will end. Time flies. There wasn&#8217;t much happening last week. We just went to watch The Hobbit. I wasn&#8217;t really a fan of Lord of The Rings. I found it really boring. So I wasn&#8217;t really expecting anything from The Hobbit. But turned out The Hobbit was good. Better than LOTR. It was funny, lots of actions, and adventurous. Or maybe it&#8217;s just because there were no Men in the Hobbits. Men are so boring. Have you watched it? What do you think?</p>

<p>Yesterday we went to the last day of annual illumination in Kobe, The Luminarie. There&#8217;s nothing in this event but lights. Beautiful lights. This is one of the things I like from Japan. There are lots of festivals/events/祭り. There&#8217;s something to look forward to in every seasons.</p>

<p>The previous design of iOS Phone&#8217;s keypad was so much better. This new one in iOS 6 feels like something made by Android engineer.  （；¬＿¬)</p>
