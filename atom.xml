<p>Here is a new blog that you have to follow.<!-- more -->
From the creator of XKCD, a new blog to answer hypothetical questions with physics, <a href="http://what-if.xkcd.com/">What If</a>. I&#8217;m so fascinated by Randall Munroe&#8217;s curiosity and deep analytical skill shown in this blog.</p>

<p>Oh, and you should read this <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/09/a-conversation-with-randall-munroe-the-creator-of-xkcd/262851/">conversation with the guy himself</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>There are a lot of people who have written books about creativity that I haven&#8217;t read, so I&#8217;m not by any means an expert on it, but my impression is that being creative is just a combination of getting new stimulus, but also having periods where you&#8217;re not getting any stimulus. I had to stop reading Reddit sometime a few years ago, because I found that whenever I&#8217;d bump into a problem that was going to take a little time to solve, I&#8217;d just switch over and refresh Reddit and distract myself. Depriving myself of that has definitely been an important part of actually getting anything done, ever.</p><p>But at the same time, if you&#8217;re just staring at your room with no Internet or no connection, you just go crazy and don&#8217;t have anything to give you any ideas at all.</p></blockquote>


<p>Not with Reddit, but happens to me many times too.</p>

    <id>http://nicnocquee.com/blog/2012/09/27/thoughts-opened-facebook-and-twitter-after-a-week</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I decided to take a break from Facebook and Twitter. I deleted Facebook and Twitter app from my iPhone and resisted from opening Facebook and Twitter from the web. The reason was pretty simple. I felt that Facebook and Twitter <em>toxicated</em> my mind. There were too many posts or Tweets that were boring, stupid, unnecessary, and I found insulting to what I believe in. To respond to those posts or tweets would not only waste my time, but also mentally exhausting. Not to mention debating over something that will never have common agreement always leaves bad taste in my mouth. Therefore, I chose to keep a distance from Twitter and Facebook.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Surprisingly, I survived without opening them for a week. It was kinda weird feeling. A day without notifications felt like something was missing. There were these empty time slots in my day that I chose to fill with reading one of the books that I have piled up digitally, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SEGEKI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000SEGEKI&linkCode=as2&tag=everlasti-20">The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=everlasti-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000SEGEKI" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0O3S1u211Q2D043o070s/Screen%20Shot%202012-09-26%20at%2011.37.54%20AM.png" alt="49 Facebook Notifications" /></p>

<p>Then yesterday I opened Facebook and Twitter. I found two interesting things. The first one was on Facebook. In a week, I got 49 notifications in which only around 10 were comments or likes to my posts from this blog or pics from my Instagram. The rest was new updates from my <em>Closed Friends</em>. Then I scrolled fast through my news feed to see anything interesting. Aside from <a href="http://dallarosa.tumblr.com/">my good friend</a>&#8217;s new hair style, nothing was really interesting. So basically, I didn&#8217;t really miss anything significant. That is interesting.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/2y1h0Y1q1d3w3E3s2F1D/Screen%20Shot%202012-09-27%20at%209.47.56%20AM.png" alt="Twitter navigation tab" /></p>

<p>The second interesting thing was in Twitter. Specifically, in Twitter&#8217;s web page. The first thing I wanted to do on Twitter was to see if any body <em>mentioned</em> me. Unlike Facebook, Twitter doesn&#8217;t have the red notification bubble. But there was this blue light under the gear icon. So I figured that must be my notifications. But when I clicked it, there was only my Direct Messages. Ok, I still thought, so my Mention notification is not here. I figured maybe it&#8217;s on the <em>Me</em> icon. I mean, it says Me, so that means everything that belongs to Me should be there, doesn&#8217;t it? So I clicked it. To my surprise, it wasn&#8217;t there as well. Where is my &#8220;Mentions&#8221;?! It can&#8217;t be in that @Connect, can it? I thought @Connect is the place if you want to find some people to follow, to connect with other users, hence the name @Connect. But I was wrong. My mentions were there. That&#8217;s interesting. Either me or Twitter don&#8217;t understand user experience. Anyway, no important mentions after a week. I didn&#8217;t look at my Twitter streams, cause I knew there must be tons of tweets.</p>

<p>I can say that I am a social network addict. But like everything else, having something excessively is never a good thing. From this one week experiment, I can conclude that once a week Twitter/Facebook consumption is good for my health. So if you have anything important to tell me, please don&#8217;t do it via Facebook or Twitter. Just email me, or iMessage or text me. Thank you.</p>

<p>Note: Unfortunately, I cannot get away from Instagram. I just couldn&#8217;t miss seeing Giee-tan for a day! I mean, look at her, she&#8217;s the cutest cat in the world! ヽ(=^ ･ω･^ =)丿 Follow <a href="instagram://user?username=tiaichima">tiaichima</a> for more pics of Giee! (You have to open that link from your iPhone and must have instagram app installed).</p>

    <link href="http://nicnocquee.com/blog/2012/09/26/japanese-todays-nihonggo-number-1/"/>
    <updated>2012-09-26T00:11:00+09:00</updated>
    <id>http://nicnocquee.com/blog/2012/09/26/japanese-todays-nihonggo-number-1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://distilleryimage10.s3.amazonaws.com/fb379d44072311e29c1122000a1e8a73_7.jpg" alt="Reviewing Japanese ... #japan #kobe #osaka #kansai #manga #anime #japanese #learn" /></p>

<p>Few things I learned from todays&#8217;s nihonggo class:</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>〜ずに。which means 「<em>without</em>」.
Example: 「暑いので、子供はふとんをかけずに寝ています。」「The kid is sleeping without <em>futon</em> cause it&#8217;s hot.」 The sentence I learned today was 「出張で植木に水をやることができず、枯らしてしまった。」 which I think the meaning is 「Because of work trip, I cannot water the plant in the garden, now they withered.」</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>〜きれない。which is the negative of 〜きれる which means 「<em>all</em>」. Example: 「あの商品は人気があるらしく、発売と同時に売りきれてしまった。」「That product seems so popular that it got sold out completely when the sales started.」 The sentence I learned today was 「彼女の家には数えきれないほどの人形があるそうだ。」which means 「She has uncountable number of dolls in her house」.</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>〜につれ　which means 「<em>as in proportion to</em>」. Example: 「日本語が上手になるにつれて、友達が増え、日本での生活が楽しくなってきた。」「As I get better in Japanese, I get more friends, and life in Japan is getting fun.」The sentence I learned today was 「秋が深まるにつれ、セーターが売れるようになる。」which means 「As autumn gets closer, sweaters are being sold.」</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>〜かねる　which is the polite version of 〜できない。
Example: 「ここでは分かりかねますので、あちらのカウンターでお聞きください。」「We don&#8217;t understand here, so please ask the counter over there.」 The sentence I learned today was 「哲学者の話が分かりかねることはよくある話だ。」which means 「I don&#8217;t really understand the talk of a philosopher」.</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>〜にかける　which means 「<em>when it comes to</em>」. Example: 「足の速さにかけては自信があったのですが、若い人にはもう勝てません。」「I have confidence when it comes to my feet&#8217;s speed, but I can no longer win against young people.」 The sentence I learned today was 「歌のうまさにかけては会社の中で彼の右にでる者がない。」 which means 「When it comes to singing, nobody in the company is on a par with him.」</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>And many new kanji. Japanese is difficult orz</p>

    <updated>2012-09-23T12:55:00+09:00</updated>
    <id>http://nicnocquee.com/blog/2012/09/23/review-mac-photo-bundle</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.mightydeals.com?refID=81ccb6">Mighty Deals</a> have an interesting deal for non-pro photography enthusiasts like me, <a href="http://www.mightydeals.com/deal/macphun-photo-bundle.html?refID=81ccb6">The Mac Photo Bundle</a>. There are three apps: Snapheal, FX Studio Pro, and ColorStrokes. My favorite and the one that make the deal worth it is F<a href="http://www.fxphotostudioapp.com/">X Studio Pro</a>.<!-- more --></p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/2I3L1i2S2B2Q1i352U1X/Screen%20Shot%202012-09-23%20at%2012.17.10%20PM.png" alt="FX Studio Pro for Mac" /></p>

<p>It&#8217;s basically <a href="http://campl.us/">Camera+</a> for Mac. Lots of filters and frames to choose from. Easy navigation. Switching to another filter is easy, fast, and smooth, at least in my 11-inch, Mid 2012 Macbook Air.</p>

<p>Second one for my favorite is <a href="http://www.colorsplashphoto.com/">ColorStrokes</a>. From the website:</p>

<blockquote><p>With ColorStrokes you have the entire color palette in your hands. You can recolor the image and even bring colors to the black and white shots, thus letting your photo creativity truly blossom.</p></blockquote>


<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/191h203H252P1r1z0k2J/Screen%20Shot%202012-09-23%20at%201.16.39%20PM.png" alt="ColorStrokes for Mac in action" /></p>

<p>And the last is <a href="http://www.snapheal.com/">Snapheal</a>. To be honest, I&#8217;m not satisfied with this one. It didn&#8217;t work as expected and advertised. It depends on the photo and the object you will try to remove. Works better on small objects. Though the developers included interesting UX to prevent you from getting bored while waiting for the processing to finish.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Linden Tibbets on <a href="http://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> alerts email:</p>

<blockquote><p>In recent weeks, Twitter announced policy changes* that will affect how applications and users like yourself can interact with Twitter&#8217;s data. As a result of these changes, on September 27th we will be removing all Twitter Triggers, disabling your ability to push tweets to places like email, Evernote and Facebook. All Personal and Shared Recipes using a Twitter Trigger will also be removed. Recipes using Twitter Actions and your ability to post new tweets via IFTTT will continue to work just fine.</p></blockquote>


<p>As a user, I thought I didn&#8217;t really mind the changes in Twitter&#8217;s policy. <!-- more -->
Well, I did feel disappointed when I couldn&#8217;t use Tweetbot for Mac anymore, but there was still the web and the crappy official app. So I just let it pass.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/1P2b2R252y1j2c3t1Q3v/Screen%20Shot%202012-09-21%20at%208.50.20%20AM.png" alt="Tweetbot for Mac stopped working" /></p>

<p>Until today. For those who don&#8217;t know, <a href="http://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> is an amazing service which can let the internet services you use to <em>talk</em> with each other. One of the <em>receipes</em> I used in IFTTT is to backup my tweets to my Dropbox. As you might know, it&#8217;s really difficult to see your old tweets. Thus the backing up. However, with the Twitter&#8217;s policy change, this won&#8217;t be possible anymore. Very disappointing. Because the tweets I tweeted are my own. I should have the rights to do whatever I want to do with it.</p>

<p>Anyhow, as the wise man says, it&#8217;s for FREE, if you don&#8217;t like it, don&#8217;t use it. As a matter of fact, I have reduced using Twitter directly. My tweets mostly came from Instagram or this blog using IFTTT.</p>

    <updated>2012-09-20T12:03:00+09:00</updated>
    <id>http://nicnocquee.com/blog/2012/09/20/thoughts-speaking-of-smartphones-revolution</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Andrew Wulf on <a href="http://thecodist.com/article/i_39_m_sorry_but_the_revolution_in_smartphones_is_long_over">I&#8217;m sorry but the revolution in smartphones is long over</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Will there ever be a real innovation in the smartphone market anytime soon? I doubt it. Maybe plugging into my brain directly (a scary concept) but I can&#8217;t see anything remaining that would be a real game changer. Bigger and smaller phones are limited by biology. Thinner phones are very hard to make much thinner since you wind up limited by physics. Maybe flexible phones might be cool. Or foldable phones you can stick in your wallet. But making things too small runs into the issue of being easy to lose or break. So what&#8217;s left? Windows 8 has an interesting take on UI but I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s better, just different. If you try to take your UI too far away from the basic design in place (finger friendly) you might lose too many customers. Android, while partially open, can&#8217;t move too far way in its UI or risk irritating customers. Simple is a tough thing to improve.</p></blockquote>


<p>A day before iPhone 5 event, me and wifey were talking about what could make people be amazed with Apple&#8217;s announcement again.<!-- more -->
The announcement of the original iPhone seemed so exciting. It was revolutionary. A phone with apps, full touch screen, no keypads. Steve Jobs looked so <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uW-E496FXg">proud</a>. iPhone 4 brought a new excitement with the new design. More beautiful than its predecessors. Even more entertaining with <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5520471/the-tale-of-apples-next-iphone">the saga of the lost iPhone</a>. However, iPhone 4S didn&#8217;t bring the original iPhone&#8217;s level of excitement. Of course it was selling like crazy. It was the best phone at that time. And the white one? Deserved a 12-hour waiting in line under the rain in front of Apple Store, true story. Then came the iPhone 5, with so many leaks and rumors months before its launch. People lost their excitement already from the leaks. Didn&#8217;t seem like anything new but the taller display.</p>

<p>Back to our discussion, we were thinking iPhone 4/4S has the most beautiful and well designed phone ever. We couldn&#8217;t think of what kind of new design that could outmatch this phone. Simply changing the UI won&#8217;t cut it. And I&#8217;m not really a fan of transparent display and elastic phone, seems hard to use. Phone plugged to the brain? NO WAY! So we asked ourselves, what do we use phone for anyway. Hardly making calls, some playing, some texting/posting/tweeting, and mostly reading. Is there a problem with reading on iPhone. Since retina display, no problem. Text never been that clear on a phone. But without a doubt, reading in Kindle is so much better and comfortable than that in iPhone. Therefore, our crazy idea that we think could make people go crazy with the iPhone was the ability to change the display of iPhone to the <em>Reading Mode</em>. With a press of a switch/button, the display can toggle between paper like display for reading and the LED backlit display. That would be revolutionary. But very unlikely.</p>

<p>Enough daydreaming. Back to work, back to work &#8230;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.shoeboxblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/new-blog7.jpg" alt="Welcome to blogging" /></p>

<p>Recently, I see a trend of what I call <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a> style of blogging. I called it that way just because John Gruber&#8217;s blog was the first one I saw using that style. Using DF style, every post is short. There&#8217;s always a quote from other article and accompanied by comment from the blogger. Sometimes a long comment. Most of the time very short, like <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/01/22/rim">one word only</a>. It doesn&#8217;t seem like a hard thing to do. And the rumor even said that <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/daring-fireball-2011-3">John earned a ton of cash</a> from his blog.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m so amazed by people who are constantly updating their blogs with new posts. Even more amazed by those who make money and make a living out of blogging. Because I find blogging a hard thing to do. It takes lots of thinking and time. What to write. How to write it. Search for other articles that can backup what you wrote. Which is why I think Twitter and Facebook became so popular. You don&#8217;t really think to tweet or post to Facebook.</p>

<p>So the point of this post is … nothing actually. I just saw the comic strip above from <a href="http://www.shoeboxblog.com/?p=32420">shoeboxblog.com</a> and it made me want to express my opinion on how hard blogging is. Of course I can simply say in Twitter or Facebook, &#8220;Blogging is hard&#8221;. But I&#8217;m in the middle of Facebook/Twitter fasting. What&#8217;s that? Next time. Be patient young Jedi.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using many blogging services. Started with Wordpress, Blogger, Tumblr and most recent one was Posterous. I was satisfied with Posterous, until Twitter acquired them. For some reason, the posts I sent via email got published hours after I sent them. Asked them via Twitter about this but no response. So I figured it is time to move on.</p>

<p>Going forward, I&#8217;m going to use <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>+<a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> for blogging. Not really easy to setup, but seems cool. And this is the first post. I thought simply posting &#8220;Hello world&#8221; or &#8220;This is my first post&#8221; will be so boring. So I share with you a video from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/davidmitchellsoapbox?feature=watch">David Mitchell</a>. I mean, just for his voice this video has to be shared.</p>

<p>Until next time.</p>
