I've been using many blogging services. Started with Wordpress, Blogger, Tumblr and most recent one was Posterous. I was satisfied with Posterous, until Twitter acquired them. For some reason, the posts I sent via email got published hours after I sent them. Asked them via Twitter about this but no response. So I figured it is time to move on.

<!-- more -->

Going forward, I'm going to use [Octopress](http://octopress.org/)+[Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) for blogging. Not really easy to setup, but seems cool. And this is the first post. I thought simply posting "Hello world" or "This is my first post" will be so boring. So I share with you a video from [David Mitchell](http://www.youtube.com/user/davidmitchellsoapbox?feature=watch). I mean, just for his voice this video has to be shared.

Until next time.
