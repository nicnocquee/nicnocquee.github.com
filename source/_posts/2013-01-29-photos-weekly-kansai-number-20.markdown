So [Ninja Blocks](http://ninjablocks.com/) came last week. Still thinking of what to do with it though. And also when to play with it. 😜 Weekend was busy with [Facebook Hacker Cup](https://www.facebook.com/hackercup). Did you participate? How did you do? I couldn't finish the third problem. The program I wrote worked, but took quite some time to complete a test case. （＞д＜）

Got good news today. I passed the Japanese Language Proficiency Test Level 2! ＼（Ｔ∇Ｔ）／  Barely passed it though. Maybe I'll take level 2 again this year and will aim for a better score. Did you take one? How was the result?
