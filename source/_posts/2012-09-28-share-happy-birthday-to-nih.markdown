![Too bad they did not invent anything on my birthday](http://f.cl.ly/items/2R0W37371Z2z0T0D041a/Screen%20Shot%202012-09-28%20at%2012.36.30%20AM.png)

I am following some web comics via Google Reader,<!-- more --> 
like [Abstruse Goose](http://abstrusegoose.com/), [Geek and Poke](http://geek-and-poke.com/), [PhD Comics](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php), [XKCD](http://xkcd.com/), and many more. And apparently one of them is having birthday today. Happy birthday to [Not Invented Here](http://notinventedhe.re/)! I didn't know it from the beginning, but I enjoy it so far. Keep up the good work! ☆ﾐ(o*･ω･)ﾉ
