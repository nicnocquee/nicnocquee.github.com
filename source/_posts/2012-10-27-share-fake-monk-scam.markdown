Japan Probe on [Fake monk fundraising scam targets foreign tourists in Tokyo](http://www.japanprobe.com/2012/10/24/fake-monk-fundraising-scam-targets-foreign-tourists-in-tokyo/):

{% blockquote %}
The “monks” approach tourists, hand them a golden good luck charm, and ask for a donation. Many tourists are happy to donate to such a noble cause. The fundraisers seem to target foreign tourists, but they also occasionally approach Japanese people. In a short time, the men can raise many thousands of yen.

My wife was a victim of this. And I don't think she was happy to donate, because the monk was persistent to the point of forcing. She was victimized in Takeshita Street of Harajuku. Be extra careful, people.
