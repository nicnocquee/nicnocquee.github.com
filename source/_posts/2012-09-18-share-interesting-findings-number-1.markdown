* [Android is no longer (actually has been for a long time but this just confirmed it) open](http://www.nasdaq.com/article/acer-cancels-press-conference-to-launch-new-smartphone-on-alibaba-software-20120913-00197). Danny Sullivan suggested Google to [separate Android into two with different names](http://marketingland.com/what-is-the-one-true-android-and-how-open-is-it-21664) to avoid confusion. If I may, I suggest Android FREE and Android Pro. But Jason Harrop on [the comment](http://marketingland.com/what-is-the-one-true-android-and-how-open-is-it-21664#comment-651724639) gave the best name for the free version.

* [iPhone 5 pre-order has been very disappointing](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/09/17iPhone-5-Pre-Orders-Top-Two-Million-in-First-24-Hours.html). Oops, forgot to add **\<sarcasm\>** tag there. Too bad I cannot be part of the two million sheeps because my 4S contract is still not done yet.

* Love this illustration of [Wolverine](http://geektyrant.com/storage/0999-post-images/wloverine9152012.png?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1347816917813). Via [GeekTyrant](http://geektyrant.com/news/2012/9/16/great-piece-of-wolverine-geek-art-by-jeff-agala.html).

* This! I so want it!! [Pretty expensive though](http://www.etsy.com/listing/107349237/snorlax-pokemon-full-size-bean-bag-chair), maybe somebody is kind enough to buy it for me? haha. Via [Technabob](http://technabob.com/blog/2012/09/15/pokemon-snorlax-bean-bag-chair/). ![Snorlax bean bag](http://technabob.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/snorlax_bean_bag_1.jpg)

* [50% e-books campaign in O'Reilly](http://shop.oreilly.com/category/deals/b2s-2012-special.do?imm_mid=095204&cmp=em-npa-books-videos-b2s-finalday-direct) is going to end soon. Better grab books that interest you fast. I purchased [one](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920018025.do?code=B2S2).
