As I write this sentence on my MBA which rests on my lap, the digital clock at the top right corner shows "Fri Jan 4 11:26:50 PM". In around 30 minutes, it will be January 5. It's been 4 days since the year 2013 closed the door of 2012 and came to our life. The holiday for most people in Japan has ended yesterday. Yet here I am feeling like finally I can say "Happy new year!" sincerelly.

Danny Choo asked good questions on his post [2013 New Years Greetings!](http://www.dannychoo.com/post/en/26806/2013+New+Years+Greetings.html):

{% blockquote %}
Happy new year folks! Hows your new year celebrations? 
But before you answer that, have you ever thought to yourself why we celebrate the new year? Is it because we want to celebrate what we have achieved in the previous year? Is it because we are celebrating what we want to do in the up n coming year? Is it because we are celebrating the fact that most of us get time off work/school?
{% endblockquote %}

In my opinion, new year is a good time to start things new. Either starting something really new, or simply restarting what we have been doing. But remember what [Oracle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_Revolutions) said,

{% blockquote %}
everything that has a beginning has an end
{% endblockquote %}

There are ways to read that between the line, but I'd like to think that to really begin, we need to end something. I had not finished what I wanted to finish in 2012. Thus, I did not fully celebrate new year.

This year, we, as in me and wifey, *celebrated* new year differently compared to previous years. Last year, we spent new year in Ise together with our friends. However, this year it was just the two of us in our apartment. We were just there sitting on the yellow sofa I got nearly three years ago, if my memory serves me right, from an Indian guy whom I didn't (still don't) know. We were watching Japanese TV Show called [Kohaku (紅白) Uta Gassen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dhaku_Uta_Gassen) where a bunch of Japanese singers and musicians was divided into two teams, red and white teams, and they competed with each other.

![Maki-chan on Kohaku](http://f.cl.ly/items/222Q0y0W1Y2h3I3s460T/maki-chan1.png)

But we weren't really watching the show. We were most of the time looking at our Macbook's monitors. I was busy with XCode while wifey was busy with Photoshop. We were working on Scribeit. Scribeit is the second app I put in Apple Store. It is my first paid app. And it is the only paid app at this moment. It's been two years since I updated it. It was never even updated to support retina display when iPhone 4 was released. Despite of that, number of downloads every month never reaches zero. So I finally made up my mind to update this baby and to finish it before 2012 came to an end. And my wife helped me with the graphics and stuff.

Unfortunately, everything doesn't always work as planned. As this part of the world turned from December 31 to January 1, Scribeit was not completely done yet. An unexpected behaviour in the app prevented me from fully enjoying the moment where people celebrated the first year since 1987 to have four different numbers!

At around 3AM of January 1, I finally found the problem. I closed my Mac and decided to wrap things up in the morning. Then came January 2. Followed by January 3. You see, I realized that contrary to popular belief, *finishing* is way more difficult than starting. You can always start *small*, but you cannot finish small. You can start from small things one by one. But you cannot finish only a part of the whole. Of course there's no such thing as completely **finish**. There's always something to add. Or to reduce. I'm talking about finishing the [MVP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product). You cannot ship a half ass product. You need to reach that state of MVP. And here's a fact: even an MVP has many check lists to complete. If you think starting is hard, finishing will be hell for you. 

So, on the last day of new year holiday, I was finally able to submit our baby to App Store. We think it looks amazing. We love it. And we think you'll love it too. ♡＾▽＾♡ Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nicnocquee) to know when the update is available on the App Store.

☆☆ Happy new year!
