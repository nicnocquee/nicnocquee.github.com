I have decided before not to respond to any articles shared by friends, comments, tweets, or facebook updates which belittle Apple because I figured not only it will just waste my time and energy, it is also their rights to speak up their mind.

But this time, it's a little bit special because the status update of a friend specifically says at the beginning,

<!-- more -->

{% blockquote %}
I really want all of you (mostly to apple fans) to actually try and read this. Try to understand every point that this guy made.
{% endblockquote %}

So he purposely dedicate the status update to specifically Apple fan. I feel obliged to response. Let's start with figuring out what the purpose of his status is. 

{% blockquote %}

{% endblockquote %} 

When I ridiculed or made bad remark on Android, Amazon, Samsung, etc, I usually don't specifically address it to the users the specific service/product. I don't have any agenda to convince the users to leave or ditch the service/product or for the users to understand. I just speak up my mind. Even the article from  [Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/dear-apple-im-leaving-you-2012-11) doesn't ask Apple fans to read. It's the thought of the writer about the reason he's leaving Apple, except for the iPad, and the Macbook Air. But this friend said he wanted us to read and understand. So he's trying to convince Apple fans.
