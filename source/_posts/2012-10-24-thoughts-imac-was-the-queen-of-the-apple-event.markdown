![The iPad mini](http://f.cl.ly/items/1v1O2A290s0k0p0r2A1t/ipadmini.jpg)

First thing I did this morning when I woke up was to pick up my iPad which was lying on the side of my bed all night, opened Safari, typed in apple.com. iPad mini was the first thing I saw. Watching the video of the iPad mini, me and wifey thought, "we want it!" It looks lighter, and easier to hold.

But then, John Gruber [said](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/10/23/ipad-mini-dalrymple):

{% blockquote %}
Screen resolution-wise, it’s exactly what I expected for a 163 PPI display in 2012: noticeably nicer than the 133 PPI iPad 1/2, noticeably worse than the 266 PPI iPad 3/4. The iPad Mini display seems brighter and to have better contrast than the iPhone 3GS display, but unsurprisingly, rendered text looks exactly like it does on the 3GS.
{% endblockquote %}

**Rendered text looks exactly like it does on the 3GS**. Now that's a turn off. The thing I like the most from iPhone 4/4S and the (not so) new iPad was the retina display which display text sharply. If this iPad mini cannot do that, I guess we'll wait for the next generation.

Then we watched the [keynote](http://www.apple.com/apple-events/october-2012/). Tim Cook took the stage as usual. Boring. Then [Phil Schiller ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Schiller)came in. We kinda like this guy. As my wife said, "Phil doesn't try to be Steve Jobs when he's on stage." I agreed with her. He showed the new 13" Macbook Pro with Retina Display, new Mac Mini, and then. [The new iMac](http://www.apple.com/imac/features/). It's amazing. I was stunned. Very thin. Very beautiful. It deserves the title of the queen of the event.

But what excites me the most about this iMac is it feels Job-sy. First, it's unexpected. Nobody predicted this. Everybody was so busy talking about the iPad mini. No rumors (as far as I know) talked about the new iMac. It's the surprise that I have been missing from apple events since the first iPad. Second, Apple made a bold move by removing optical drive from this new iMac. iMac is a desktop computer. With many DVDs and Blu-rays still being sold these days, removing the optical drive from a desktop computer required the guts and courage only Jobs has. And Apple still has it. Good job. Your move, Samsung.

![Oh, and the Fusion drive in the iMac, sounds so ballsy](http://mangapournous.m.a.pic.centerblog.net/050930180636_4.gif)

Final thought, stil hoping for Macbook Air 11" with Retina display…
