**September** 9 2014 ~~Apple~~ Live Event was not `my favorite Apple event`. I'll even say that it was the _worst_ Apple event ever. I haven't rewatched the keynote (probably never will) and haven't read any reviews of the keynote. So here's my review.

<!--more-->

- Tim Cook decided to hold the event in a different place from where they usually did in the past. This resulted in a terrible streaming quality where I completely missed what's so great about the new iPhones.
- Apple was trying to explain to developers that they should have `Localizable.strings (Chinese)` file in their app by hiring a Chinese lady to speak non-stop louder than Phil Schiller.
- iPhone 6 is amazing. Freeze. Claps. Mute.  Repeat.
