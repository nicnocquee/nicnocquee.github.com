[Marco Ament](http://www.marco.org/) on the [Foreword of The Magazine](http://the-magazine.org/1/foreword):

{% blockquote %}
Many iPad magazines are carrying unnecessary and expensive baggage from their print days. Some born-digital magazines even took on print baggage simply because they thought they needed it.

Indeed.

![The Magazine for iPad](http://f.cl.ly/items/3D3n1h3g0D1Q1s2a0p02/2012-10-12%20at%2005:27.png)

With many problems like the [wifi issue](http://9to5mac.com/2012/04/04/apple-investigating-new-ipad-wifi-issues-tells-applecare-to-replace-affected-units/), I have been hesitant to upgrade my iPad to iOS 6. But The Magazine is approved by [John Grubber](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/10/11/the-magazine). And concurred by [MG Siegler](http://parislemon.com/post/33417889715/marco-arment-launches-the-magazine). A week free trial. Furthermore, I like reading articles. And this one looks slick. But it needs iOS 6. There, I installed it. Let's see if it's worth it. You can download The Magazine from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/magazine-for-geeks-like-us./id557744510?mt=8).
