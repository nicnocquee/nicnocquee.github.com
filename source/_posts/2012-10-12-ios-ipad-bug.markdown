![Weird iPad Bug](http://f.cl.ly/items/16082b2k0s2f0l230R1G/2012-10-12%20at%2004:07.png)

It just suddenly happened today. Just swiped to the Search screen and went back to home screen. Normally, the keyboard hides automatically. But not this time. (￣(エ)￣)ゞ

<!-- more -->

Keyboard will not be suppressed. Keyboard will fight back.
