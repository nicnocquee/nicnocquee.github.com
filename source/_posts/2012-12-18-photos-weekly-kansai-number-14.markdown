Two more weeks then boom. 2012 will end. Time flies. There wasn't much happening last week. We just went to watch The Hobbit. I wasn't really a fan of Lord of The Rings. I found it really boring. So I wasn't really expecting anything from The Hobbit. But turned out The Hobbit was good. Better than LOTR. It was funny, lots of actions, and adventurous. Or maybe it's just because there were no Men in the Hobbits. Men are so boring. Have you watched it? What do you think?

Yesterday we went to the last day of annual illumination in Kobe, The Luminarie. There's nothing in this event but lights. Beautiful lights. This is one of the things I like from Japan. There are lots of festivals/events/祭り. There's something to look forward to in every seasons.
