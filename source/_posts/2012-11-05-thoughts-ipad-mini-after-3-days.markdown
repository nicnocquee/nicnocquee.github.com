[Apple managed to sell three million iPads in three days](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/11/05Apple-Sells-Three-Million-iPads-in-Three-Days.html):

{% blockquote %}
CUPERTINO, California—November 5, 2012—Apple® today announced it has sold three million iPads in just three days since the launch of its new iPad® mini and fourth generation iPad—double the previous first weekend milestone of 1.5 million Wi-Fi only models sold for the third generation iPad in March.
{% endblockquote %}

I can't believe it's been three days since I started using iPad Mini. It feels like I've been using it for a long time. It just fits to my life (and my jacket pocket and my bag) better than the big bro iPad. Even without the retina display, I enjoy reading books and articles on it. Apparently I am not the only one.

Interesting bits on the announcement is that Apple didn't announce how many iPad Mini they have sold. It's 3 millions iPads which include both iPad Mini and the iPad 4 (or the Newer iPad, whatever). So I thought it could also mean that the majority of the iPads sold is the iPad 4 and nobody wanted iPad mini. But Mr. Tim Cook answered in the next paragraph,

{% blockquote %}
“Customers around the world love the new iPad mini and fourth generation iPad,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We set a new launch weekend record and practically sold out of iPad minis. We're working hard to build more quickly to meet the incredible demand.” 
{% endblockquote %}

Sold out. So the [pricing indeed was not intended to compete with the competitors' tablet](http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/10/24/why-apple-doesnt-care-about-its-competition/), but to fill up the gap between Apple's line of products.

But why didn't Apple announce the real number of iPad mini sold? Now that I think about it, the answer to this question proves that what I thought about Apple was wrong. I didn't write or post or tweet about that thought (because you know, you don't really have to tell your so-called friends and followers about everything), but I was hoping Apple was not going to make iPad mini. I thought by releasing a small version of the iPad *after* Google released the most praised Android tablet, Google Nexus 7, Apple has fallen back and became a *follower*. But it seems not the case here. iPad mini is to iPad what Macbook Air is to Macbook Pro. Or it can also be, iPad mini is to iPad what Macbook Air 11" is to Macbook Air 13". As far as I know, Apple never announced individual numbers of MBA and MBP sold. Or each numbers of MBA 11" and MBA 13". They are all Macbooks. They are the choices Apple gives to the customers. Same with the iPads.

I have a feeling that when Apple finally releases iPad mini with retina display, the history of iPhone cannibalizing the iPod will repeat once again. We'll see.
