Jobs on [Walter Isaacson's Steve Jobs](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004W2UBYW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=everlasti-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004W2UBYW):

I never worried about money. I grew up in a middle-class family, so I never thought I would starve. And I learned at Atari that I could be an okay engineer, so I always knew I could get by. I was voluntarily poor when I was in college and India, and I lived a pretty simple life even when I was working. So I went from fairly poor, which was wonderful, because I didn’t have to worry about money, to being incredibly rich, when I also didn’t have to worry about money.

Lucky him. Money depresses me everytime. Actually, thinking about money depresses me. It's not that I lack money. It's enough to enjoy and stay alive. And I'm very grateful for it. It's just not enough to make me not to worry about it. I'm not worrying about it every seconds. But it just has to come from time to time to slap me in the face to remind me to worry about it. Are you following me? Me neither.
