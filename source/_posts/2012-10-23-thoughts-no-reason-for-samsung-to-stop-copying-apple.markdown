Samsung did it again:

Some previous amusing works by Samsung's designers:

We all can call Samsung shameless copycat. But there's just no reason, but conscience, to stop executing this strategy. The worst that could happen to them was a mere [$1 billion](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/jury-returns-verdict-in-apple-v-samsung/). Nothing compared to their [$7.3 billion profit](http://venturebeat.com/2012/10/05/samsung-record-7-1-billion-profit/).

This strategy just works.
